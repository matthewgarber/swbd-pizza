sw04400-A_008049-008250 with your logic there my uh
sw04400-A_008250-008351 [noise]
sw04400-A_008351-008442 uh
sw04400-A_008442-008545 [noise]
sw04400-A_008545-009094 feelings about cars are i'd look under the hood and i see all the um
sw04400-A_009094-009497 all the stuff under there and i say boy my chances of of doing
sw04400-A_009497-010026 how shall i say it uh everything's electronic uh [noise] uh it's not that i'd
sw04400-A_010026-011230 i mean cancel [laughter-their] [laughter-time] it's just that uh there's so much you know you can't and you can't tune it yourself you can't do anything it's because you don't have the the tools to measure it on on the other hand i'm i- i have a
sw04400-A_011230-012176 a ninety Honda and uh i'm kind of on the other end of the spectrum i have let's see i have uh twelve thousand miles on a little over a two year old car
sw04400-A_012176-012329 and uh
sw04400-A_012329-012509 [noise]
sw04400-A_012509-013250 so yeah and it's a it's a absolutely flawless car it uh and it's the smoothest car i've ever ridden i uh [noise]
sw04400-A_013250-013546 ah [vocalized-noise] what's that
sw04400-A_013546-014445 Accord yes and uh so the the things that personally if i ever if i had to buy another car uh
sw04400-A_014445-014561 [silence]
sw04400-A_014561-015193 huh i'd be [vocalized-noise] the the new American cars uh their ads intrigue me
sw04400-A_015193-015805 because they think they can catch up uh with uh the Japanese but as far as
sw04400-A_015805-016368 i- i think one of the things that they are going to have to impress me with is is again this uh
sw04400-A_016368-017108 [noise] the thing that impresses you about yours and that's uh frequency of repair and and absolute reliability
sw04400-A_017108-017846 because the worst thing that can happen to a person is i think is uh to have to go in and get it fixed you know it's it's
sw04400-A_017846-017968 [silence]
sw04400-A_017968-018699 yeah [vocalized-noise] there's a a that that was i- i noticed that uh uh with one of my other cars uh
sw04400-A_018699-019880 if if there's this kind of uh natural curve of decay you know decay curve uh half the time when you take it in it's farther down the and you get it back it's farther down the curve than when you took it in
sw04400-A_019880-020841 because_1 those guys are they're being paid for uh you know last time i had my car re[paired]- uh even even this car i took it in they said sixty dollars an hour and
sw04400-A_020841-020938 and
sw04400-A_020938-021085 [silence]
sw04400-A_021085-021325 [vocalized-noise] well i said sixty dollars an hour
sw04400-A_021325-021558 [silence]
sw04400-A_021558-022317 they charged me a hundred and thirty dollars labor but they clocked my car out at an hour after they clocked it in
sw04400-A_022317-023106 so they they charged me for two and a half you know basically two and a half hours uh labor an hour later and i asked them about that and they said that's uh
sw04400-A_023106-023925 oh that's flat rate sir you know that they look it up in the book and if it takes an hour to do something why and they can get it done in thirty minutes why they charge you an hour
sw04400-A_023925-024238 so anyway those that uh
sw04400-A_024238-024481 [silence]
sw04400-A_024481-025295 yeah so uh anyway what i'm looking for is is reliability because i wanna keep it away from the from the uh the repair people
sw04400-A_025295-025614 and the other thing i'm i guess i'd be looking for is uh
sw04400-A_025614-025735 um
sw04400-A_025735-026218 you know mileage counts with me even though i even though i don't drive that much i i like mileage

sw04400-B_002561-003391 uh but i- i just decided i wasn't gonna get [laughter] i wasn't first of all i wasn't gonna get a Japanese car that was about the time that uh
sw04400-B_003391-004154 you know all the all the sort of {antitrade} stuff was going on [noise] and then uh later decided that uh
sw04400-B_004154-005071 i'd just hang on to my own car which has about two hundred and eighteen thousand miles [laughter-on] [laughter-it] it's a Chevy Celebrity [laughter-four] cylinder

sw04400-B_006095-006789 uh in fact i got my wife a a used car that was uh also a Chevy Celebrity because
sw04400-B_006789-007909 you know i've i had good luck and uh i knew enough about all the the basic maintenance you know brakes oil and that kind of stuff to do it myself so

sw04400-B_027957-029222 i don't know four out of five cars that he tows are Japanese cars and he said he j[ust]- he didn't why you know he'd been in the he'd been in the business for awhile and he wasn't sure maybe it was because people who bought those cars
sw04400-B_029222-029872 you know would would rather have it towed than try some other thing you know like you know having somebody drag it home with a chain
sw04421-A_000000-000090 [noise]
sw04421-A_000090-000283 [silence]

sw04421-A_000493-000780 [silence]
sw04421-A_000780-000947 personally i think it's good
sw04421-A_000947-001077 [silence]
sw04421-A_001077-001246 i think um
sw04421-A_001246-001546 there's a lot of things that that um
sw04421-A_001546-001653 [silence]
sw04421-A_001653-001818 you can learn from
sw04421-A_001818-002207 helping other people and doing things that need to be done
sw04421-A_002207-003179 and as i look around i see most of the things that i enjoy like i just got back from vacation and the freeways were were built by somebody else paid by somebody else and
sw04421-A_003179-003284 [silence]
sw04421-A_003284-003603 and um wouldn't hurt to do some of that myself
sw04421-A_003603-004122 [silence]
sw04421-A_004122-004736 i- i did a two and a half um [noise] two and a half year volunteer um
sw04421-A_004736-004908 [silence]
sw04421-A_004908-005431 how shall i say it uh service in the Far East for my church
sw04421-A_005431-005548 yeah
sw04421-A_005548-005741 uh Latter Day Saint church
sw04421-A_005741-005860 [silence]
sw04421-A_005860-006015 and um
sw04421-A_006015-006160 so it was
sw04421-A_006160-007138 it was um it was a great uh thing and and i know some other people that who've that have um come back from that and joined the Peace Corps and
sw04421-A_007138-008253 you know went on uh contributing and and like i say in every case uh they benefited and i'm they have lifelong happy memories about about uh
sw04421-A_008253-009414 the things that they did now does that mean that everybody is going to have happy memories well [noise] i don't know but in Europe an[d]- in many states in Europe they do the same thing they they want everybody to to uh
sw04421-A_009414-010024 not necessarily join the mil[itary]- military but have you know mandatory uh [noise]
sw04421-A_010024-010275 volunteer service of some kind
sw04421-A_010275-010388 [silence]
sw04421-A_010388-010547 so how about you
sw04421-A_010547-011690 [silence]
sw04421-A_011690-011806 yes
sw04421-A_011806-017664 [silence]
sw04421-A_017664-018047 [laughter]
sw04421-A_018047-018652 [silence]
sw04421-A_018652-019306 yeah well well that's part of the how shall i say it that's part of the experience i think because not every
sw04421-A_019306-019554 [noise] oh how shall i say it not every uh
sw04421-A_019554-019703 [silence]
sw04421-A_019703-020926 not every place we go has has great weather i uh you know sometimes you come back and and you say um that was an interesting trip [laughter] but i guess what i'm saying is that that
sw04421-A_020926-021436 overall the the benefits of of uh volunteer service
sw04421-A_021436-022176 uh are just infectious they they get you remember the people you helped and it's not all money money money money
sw04421-A_022176-023257 and uh it's really useful to to making you well like i say feel like you contribute i know after i spent my time in the Far East i came back and i said well
sw04421-A_023257-023372 [silence]
sw04421-A_023372-024001 of all the bad things i've done in my life and of all the times i wimped out and haven't done anything at least i've done something
sw04421-A_024001-024174 for that period of time
sw04421-A_024174-024376 [noise] and uh
sw04421-A_024376-024570 you know it's um how shall i say it
sw04421-A_024570-024690 [silence]
sw04421-A_024690-024940 it's not a cure all but uh
sw04421-A_024940-025052 [silence]
sw04421-A_025052-025896 the other thing that i've that i like i say i feel is that there's a a lot of people out there that that just have tons of time and uh
sw04421-A_025896-026552 they don't know what they're going to do with their life and and as you pointed out if they've get out and see if uh uh life from a
sw04421-A_026552-026877 from a different uh perspective
sw04421-A_026877-027228 then uh [noise] they have a better focus
sw04421-A_027228-027359 [silence]
sw04421-A_027359-027615 a[nd]- and let's see what else
sw04421-A_027615-028048 i- i think the only difficulty is going to be um
sw04421-A_028048-028225 [silence]
sw04421-A_028225-028376 if it becomes
sw04421-A_028376-029158 well i think we'd have to learn a lot from the European uh style uh because i know that in America there's
sw04421-A_029158-029952 sometimes there's a tendency to let everybody do their own thing to the point that that uh it might become
sw04421-B_000000-000039 [noise]
sw04421-B_000039-000291 so what do you think about mandatory public service
sw04421-B_000291-000975 [silence]
sw04421-B_000975-001067 uh-huh
sw04421-B_001067-003623 [silence]
sw04421-B_003623-004090 right were you ever in the military or public service of any kind
sw04421-B_004090-005376 [silence]
sw04421-B_005376-005466 oh really
sw04421-B_005466-005585 what denomination
sw04421-B_005585-005717 [silence]
sw04421-B_005717-005805 uh-huh
sw04421-B_005805-010239 [silence]
sw04421-B_010239-010349 right
sw04421-B_010349-010512 [silence]
sw04421-B_010512-010731 i think it's also a good idea
sw04421-B_010731-011058 people that i've i was just thinking this morning about
sw04421-B_011058-011194 how
sw04421-B_011194-011640 [silence]
sw04421-B_011640-011741 are you there
sw04421-B_011741-012464 okay hi um i was just thinking this morning about how people tend to get off into a
sw04421-B_012464-013642 to one narrow track and one narrow focus and don't get an opportunity to go out and look and experience other people and other ways of doing things
sw04421-B_013642-015011 so in particular i was thinking about up in lately visiting around to a lot of different congregations and the preachers that i've heard that have just grown up and stayed into one particular denomination
sw04421-B_015011-015873 are not nearly as good and um expansive as the ones that have come from a different denomination to the one they're in now
sw04421-B_015873-016283 so in terms of having life experience
sw04421-B_016283-016773 and a better appreciation for other people and other points of view i think
sw04421-B_016773-017349 the mandatory volunteer service is a great thing great idea the problem is
sw04421-B_017349-017746 that as you say not everybody will have a great experience
sw04421-B_017746-018654 the ones that are wanting to do it tend to have great experiences though some of our friends that joined the Peace Corps have been really lonely
sw04421-B_018654-022107 [silence]

sw04433-A_007995-008542 [vocalized-noise] that's what crime is doing in the cities it's turning those that live in the cities into prisoners [laughter]
sw04433-A_008542-008685 it's just
sw04433-A_008685-009024 uh actually i'm in a suburb of Dallas where it's
sw04433-A_009024-009356 safer in general than it is in the big city
sw04433-A_009356-009525 it um
sw04433-A_009525-010000 i think it's like most cities and that is the high crime areas are the
sw04433-A_010000-010254 ones where there's more poverty
sw04433-A_010254-010727 the you know that [laughter] there's always one part of town
sw04433-A_010727-011251 uh whether it's the Bronx or whether it's a certain area in Dallas or whatever
sw04433-A_011251-011402 uh
sw04433-A_011402-012431 i- i think that's where the crime is concentrated but gosh we just there was just one over in Fort Worth a woman was killed and her husband was uh badly injured
sw04433-A_012431-012924 and they've charged the uh the husband's daughter
sw04433-A_012924-013350 with hiring two of her teenage friends to kill her
sw04433-A_013350-013586 dad and stuff yeah
sw04433-A_013586-014089 isn't that incredible and i mean uh that that's crime that's
sw04433-A_014089-014928 that you don't usually think about i mean you if you if you're going to carry on a conversation about crime you know you think of the hardened criminal that keeps
sw04433-A_014928-015069 uh
sw04433-A_015069-015955 a[ttacking]- attacking again and again if you will whether you know depending on what his game is maybe it's an armed robber who does it all the time but this is uh [laughter]

sw04433-B_000000-000176 [noise]
sw04433-B_000176-000819 uh actually we live out in Gainesville Virginia and uh my wife is originally from the Bronx
sw04433-B_000819-001500 so for the longest time we didn't have any any kind of crime protection on our house at all because we lived way out in the country here
sw04433-B_001500-002700 and uh then you know over the years we visited her folks and her folks have probably the most impressive crime reduction system i've ever seen on any house you know they have grates across every single window
sw04433-B_002700-003035 they have probably three or four dead bolts on every door
sw04433-B_003035-004264 um just uh an amazing array of um you know sort of security measures on their house i mean it's harder to get into their house than it is probably [laughter] a lot of minimum security [laughter-prisons]
sw04433-B_004264-005505 so anyway now she's turning our house into sort of the same thing [laughter] we have uh we have like grates on the on the uh door on the basement windows even though there's very little crime in this area
sw04433-B_005505-006741 and we just had a a guy come out a locksmith come out and put all those on as well as sort of reinforce all of our dead bolts and uh put new locks in on some doors and fix our French doors up so that they were
sw04433-B_006741-006948 you know secure
sw04433-B_006948-007108 so
sw04433-B_007108-007891 [silence]
sw04433-B_007891-008023 yeah
sw04433-B_008023-008473 [silence]
sw04433-B_008473-008729 yeah what's it like in Dallas

sw04433-B_011812-013314 [silence]
sw04433-B_013314-013512 [laughter-oh] man
sw04433-B_013512-013647 incredible
sw04433-B_013647-015305 [silence]
sw04433-B_015305-015439 yeah
sw04433-B_015439-015894 [silence]
sw04433-B_015894-016001 yeah
sw04433-B_016001-016481 yeah it's clearly i- i mean it's they're not in category of business criminals i mean there's
sw04433-B_016481-017184 there's criminals who are in it just because that's their business you know [laughter] i mean that's their trade essentially and
sw04433-B_017184-018371 you know then there's then there's the really random acts of violence we actually had a a woman who was very close to our house which sort of inspired my wife to you know beef up our own security measures here
sw04433-B_018371-019083 uh she was a couple of houses away and her husband travels a lot and is gone you know for weeks on end
sw04433-B_019083-019839 and she was upstairs with her uh child and heard somebody say hello hello from downstairs
sw04433-B_019839-020143 so she immediately calls 911
sw04433-B_020143-021021 and uh the Prince William County police come over and of course the woman kept her on the phone the whole time which i thought was a really good security measure because
sw04433-B_021021-021875 you know if you can get 911 Gainesville Virginia you know [laughter] you're probably you know i mean it's probably a pretty effective thing you know
sw04433-B_021875-022913 um so anyway the police showed up and they told her the person on the phone told her to run you know take the child and run downstairs and to let the police in because_1 they were at her front door
sw04433-B_022913-023870 and so she did that and when she opened the front door she'd just bought this new German Shepherd puppy which had apparently you know uh gone all over the floor
sw04433-B_023870-024773 so the the policeman stepped into the front door and actually started sliding around on you know the dog mess
sw04433-B_024773-025128 and she yelled simultaneously yelled look out
sw04433-B_025128-025501 which the policeman thought was like somebody's about to shoot me
sw04433-B_025501-026671 so you know he's like spinning around in this stuff you know i mean it's a pretty comical scene but anyway when the guy finally regained his balance you know he just like get out of [laughter-house] lady and stop trying to help me
sw04433-B_026671-026854 [laughter]
sw04433-B_026854-028124 but anyway later on it's it's gonna it's uh she they didn't find anything i mean apparently you know if the guy came in he ran out and and the police tried to convince her that it was the dog playing with the remote control on the TV which just doesn't make any sense at all
sw04433-B_028124-028654 too the odds of that are just really unlikely but i actually went over
sw04433-B_028654-029863 about a week later he was back home and she was on travel and he locked himself out and i went over and within i would say about five seconds got into their garage door
sw04440-A_000000-000289 [noise] okay how you do you have kids
sw04440-A_000289-000499 [silence]
sw04440-A_000499-001007 oh they're just teenagers huh almost [laughter]
sw04440-A_001007-003851 [silence]
sw04440-A_003851-003955 yeah
sw04440-A_003955-004417 [silence]
sw04440-A_004417-004794 now now do you find th[at]- that that's uh
sw04440-A_004794-005098 see how would i say that do you find that uh
sw04440-A_005098-005226 [silence]
sw04440-A_005226-005587 [noise] that that it's well i mean it's it's
sw04440-A_005587-006007 [noise] you could do that on a Mon[day]- on a Monday do you find it
sw04440-A_006007-006350 that it's easy to do that on Monday nights or is it
sw04440-A_006350-010788 [silence]
sw04440-A_010788-011456 oh that sounds pretty good are do you find that that uh uh i guess with us
sw04440-A_011456-011613 i have uh
sw04440-A_011613-011796 four kids at home now and
sw04440-A_011796-011935 and uh
sw04440-A_011935-012709 [noise] let's see uh a six a five year old a thirteen year old uh excuse me five eleven thirteen and seventeen
sw04440-A_012709-012863 and uh
sw04440-A_012863-012894 [noise]
sw04440-A_012894-013408 Saturdays is a is it's difficult to get everybody
sw04440-A_013408-014254 organized and rounded up uh so they get the chores done and don't home in on the television immediately when they when they get up
sw04440-A_014254-014641 um actually and during the school nights uh
sw04440-A_014641-015337 uh the we have a rule now that that uh because the kids are so easily distracted by the you know
sw04440-A_015337-016020 uh [noise] that uh no television on school nights and no [noise]
sw04440-A_016020-016183 none at all
sw04440-A_016183-016309 [silence]
sw04440-A_016309-016750 it's well they think it's draconian they think it's terrible you know
sw04440-A_016750-017435 uh well no it's not that hard to enforce it's just uh because if there's you know if it's
sw04440-A_017435-017585 i found out that if
sw04440-A_017585-017747 if uh
sw04440-A_017747-018045 if i let one of them watch pretty soon they'd all be watching
sw04440-A_018045-018259 so i so i said that
sw04440-A_018259-018448 [laughter]
sw04440-A_018448-019400 well no television and no ball games and the reason no ball games is because the kids'll stick their earphones on and and listen to ball games and try and do their piano believe it or not
sw04440-A_019400-019728 [silence]
sw04440-A_019728-020035 oh is that that's that's a pretty good hobby isn't it
sw04440-A_020035-020284 [silence]
sw04440-A_020284-020432 [noise]

sw04440-A_021493-022009 [silence]
sw04440-A_022009-022280 oh is that right that's very nice
sw04440-A_022280-022402 [silence]
sw04440-A_022402-022799 well now that's kind of that's interesting to me because
sw04440-A_022799-023682 a lot of uh you know in keeping on the uh the family thing here the reason that's interesting is because i've noticed that some families have
sw04440-A_023682-023815 um
sw04440-A_023815-024194 like the the parent i knew some ham and uh
sw04440-A_024194-024335 uh
sw04440-A_024335-025214 there's a tendency and i- i think a lot of it depends on the family for like the ham to go in his in his uh room and shut the door
sw04440-A_025214-025550 in a shack and shut the door and the rest of the family was excluded
sw04440-A_025550-025776 [silence]
sw04440-A_025776-025892 and that's
sw04440-A_025892-026000 [silence]
sw04440-A_026000-026575 and the fact that and i read one time that uh there was a high divorce rate in in uh
sw04440-A_026575-027301 Cape Canaveral down there or Cape Kennedy or whatever you call it because the engineer would come home go in his study close the door and that was it
sw04440-A_027301-028280 and uh just sort of an autocrat so the fact that you've got three participants in your family that uh that do that is that's a credit to you what a[re]-
sw04440-A_028280-028712 let's say i- i guess my other question about uh
sw04440-A_028712-028848 um [noise]
sw04440-A_028848-028954 [silence]
sw04440-A_028954-029250 when it comes to when they're on their own
sw04440-A_029250-029355 [silence]
sw04440-A_029355-029748 you know i mean if if you have to go if you and your wife go someplace
sw04440-A_029748-029879 what typically
sw04440-B_000000-000239 [noise]
sw04440-B_000239-000558 yeah i have a uh twelve year old son and a fourteen year old daughter
sw04440-B_000558-000658 [silence]
sw04440-B_000658-000916 right [laughter] so uh
sw04440-B_000916-002282 so it's uh an interesting experience for us but we're kind of lucky uh in that regard because uh the church we belong to has a a program that they've had for quite a few years that they call family home evening
sw04440-B_002282-002730 and that program is designed to uh
sw04440-B_002730-003076 bring the family together at least once a week on Monday night
sw04440-B_003076-003570 so we uh i guess i could say religiously [laughter]
sw04440-B_003570-004499 dedicate Monday evening to doing just that [noise] and each each week uh each one of us takes uh responsibility for that particular Monday night
sw04440-B_004499-005288 [silence]
sw04440-B_005288-005452 that it works
sw04440-B_005452-006173 [silence]
sw04440-B_006173-007130 um-hum i[t]- because it turns out that Monday night of all of the other nights of the week generally is the one that has the least number of other outside influences going on
sw04440-B_007130-007582 so we find that it works out quite well and
sw04440-B_007582-008155 uh we actually look forward to [laughter-it] because we get to spend so little time together otherwise
sw04440-B_008155-008926 and uh as i said each one of us'll plan uh something for the particular Monday and it can be anything [noise] because it is kind of a
sw04440-B_008926-010369 a church sponsored thing once in a while we'll have a a religious lesson maybe once a month that alternates amongst us but uh we might go to a movie or we might watch something here or play a game or just sit and read or uh
sw04440-B_010369-010702 or whatever that individual feels that they would like to do
sw04440-B_010702-010883 that's what we do
sw04440-B_010883-011035 yeah

sw04440-B_019790-020604 yeah so we have a uh a hobby in common and we can talk to one another over the air too on uh on many occasions
sw04440-B_020604-021476 [noise] and uh matter of fact we're my son and i are watching the the shuttle right now uh they've got four ham radio operators on board the shuttle

sw04443-A_002950-003501 [silence]
sw04443-A_003501-004545 super yeah that's kind of the way i did it too actually i i played uh just a tiny bit when i was real young and then uh i w[ent]- i got on to a team in high school but wasn't very good still
sw04443-A_004545-005849 but and then quit for awhile and recently i picked it up like you say about a couple years ago and uh i've been playing you know off and on when i can up in Minneapolis it's not too easy to play in the winter of course but
sw04443-A_005849-006627 i actually live in Florida so uh uh i'll be going back down there in May and hopefully be picking it up a little more regularly
sw04443-A_006627-006899 [silence]
sw04443-A_006899-007147 i was going to say [laughter]
sw04443-A_007147-007530 [silence]
sw04443-A_007530-007810 yeah that's that's true all too many times
sw04443-A_007810-008539 fortunately uh down where i live in Florida there's some golf courses that are pretty reasonable if you know where to look
sw04443-A_008539-009136 um one of them is the University of Florida golf course which is open to the public and that's pretty pretty good
sw04443-A_009136-009695 [silence]
sw04443-A_009695-009801 yeah
sw04443-A_009801-009928 [silence]

sw04443-A_010248-010704 [silence]
sw04443-A_010704-011034 yeah what uh what uh what are greens fees run there
sw04443-A_011034-011772 [silence]
sw04443-A_011772-012291 okay that's yeah that's about the same i guess as it is in Florida but
sw04443-A_012291-012770 [silence]
sw04443-A_012770-012957 really oh that's super
sw04443-A_012957-013120 [silence]

sw04443-A_013239-013427 [silence]
sw04443-A_013427-013991 well that's the way to do it though that's the way to get in to some good practice without having [laughter-to] [laughter-pay] [laughter-for] [laughter-it] [laughter-all] the time
sw04443-A_013991-014407 [silence]
sw04443-A_014407-014514 yeah

sw04443-A_014801-014980 [silence]
sw04443-A_014980-016335 they need to get a new photography method because once the guy hits the ball and they got to try to follow the ball [laughter] that's that's a little difficult i mean it they do they do a generally okay job but like you said it's it's kind of boring actually
sw04443-A_016335-016780 [silence]
sw04443-A_016780-016872 oh yeah
sw04443-A_016872-017160 [silence]

sw04443-A_017986-018075 yeah
sw04443-A_018075-018791 yeah i've never been to a tournament uh you know looking at it on TV y[ou]- you thinking man [laughter] what a boring thing you know
sw04443-A_018791-019265 but uh that's that's wild though i'll have to see if i can't get a a chance to go
sw04443-A_019265-020274 [silence]

sw04443-A_021114-021477 oh you are which uh which university
sw04443-A_021477-021751 okay all right great what are you going into
sw04443-A_021751-022146 [silence]
sw04443-A_022146-022497 okay definitely not golf right [laughter]
sw04443-A_022497-022811 [silence]
sw04443-A_022811-023287 yeah if you're good you can really rake in the bucks what was that what was that movie that they had out
sw04443-A_023287-023853 th[ere]- there was a movie about a professional golfer and i i can't remember it was on network TV a couple times
sw04443-A_023853-023995 yeah
sw04443-A_023995-024353 [silence]
sw04443-A_024353-024908 that's right you got to take it easy [vocalized-noise] [laughter] yeah that's a good thing
sw04443-A_024908-026239 but uh yeah i guess when i get ba[ck]- i'm going to school in Florida actually um and fortunately i've been able to to play some golf on a student budget which is real helpful you know but
sw04443-A_026239-026749 it's it's unfortunate you know you hear about Japan i guess you know it's it's like
sw04443-A_026749-027447 two hundred and fifty dollar minimum or three hundred dollar minimum just to like to practice even insane
sw04443-A_027447-027648 [silence]
sw04443-A_027648-027790 yeah
sw04443-A_027790-027963 [laughter]
sw04443-A_027963-028208 [silence]
sw04443-A_028208-028690 yeah i guess they have those uh driving ranges that are actually stacked one on top of each other
sw04443-A_028690-028808 [silence]
sw04443-A_028808-029596 they do yeah yeah i- yeah i played uh uh eighteen holes with some Japanese guys in in Gainesville as a matter of fact
sw04443-A_029596-029978 and it was really wild they were into it you know they kicked our butt all the way to
sw04443-B_000000-000040 [noise]
sw04443-B_000040-000406 yeah i uh consider myself a hacker how about_1 you
sw04443-B_000406-000515 [silence]
sw04443-B_000515-000893 yeah uh i'm not as good as i'd like to be but it's a
sw04443-B_000893-002076 no i don't think so um i started playing when i was in elementary school actually we lived really close to a par three golf course and i'd go up there with friends after school a couple times every week and then
sw04443-B_002076-003542 for uh for years i don't know after elementary school all through junior high and stuff i didn't play because_1 i think i just got so frustrated when i was little i'd my body wasn't you know physically developed and all that kind of stuff and then i'd s[tarted]- s[tarted]- started picking it up again a couple of years back and i've really been enjoying it
sw04443-B_003542-004472 [silence]
sw04443-B_004472-004596 uh-huh
sw04443-B_004596-005451 [silence]
sw04443-B_005451-005548 right
sw04443-B_005548-005755 [silence]

sw04443-B_005836-006025 [silence]
sw04443-B_006025-006109 uh-huh
sw04443-B_006109-006576 [silence]
sw04443-B_006576-007019 right the the one factor that really bothers me is the expense of playing golf
sw04443-B_007019-007644 i mean it's a great game but i mean to play a really nice course you've got to have a really big wallet [laughter] i mean
sw04443-B_007644-007754 [silence]
sw04443-B_007754-007844 yeah
sw04443-B_007844-008492 [silence]

sw04443-B_008900-009101 [silence]
sw04443-B_009101-009764 yeah i uh attend Indiana University and it's the same way here they have a really nice championship style course that
sw04443-B_009764-009964 is fairly reasonable to play on
sw04443-B_009964-010144 [silence]
sw04443-B_010144-010848 uh a little bit but not a whole lot i mean i you'd think you would [laughter-but] [laughter-uh] you don't so i
sw04443-B_010848-010967 [silence]
sw04443-B_010967-011843 uh well they range f[rom]- anywhere from about five bucks for uh your basic city type course up to fifty sixty dollars for a really really nice course
sw04443-B_011843-012148 [silence]
sw04443-B_012148-012881 uh-huh my dad is a member of a golf club over in my home town and i can play for free there and it's a pretty nice course
sw04443-B_012881-013353 yeah and i guess it well it's free for me [laughter] yeah somebody's paying but
sw04443-B_013353-013451 not me
sw04443-B_013451-013563 [silence]
sw04443-B_013563-013675 yeah [laughter]
sw04443-B_013675-013950 [silence]
sw04443-B_013950-015033 yeah definitely as far as watching golf i mean i can watch it on TV but it's kind of boring it's nice to see those who guys they have such good style that uh it's uh [laughter] it's pretty fun to watch
sw04443-B_015033-015477 [silence]
sw04443-B_015477-015692 [laughter-right] yeah
sw04443-B_015692-016191 [silence]
sw04443-B_016191-017192 uh-huh what i really uh i uh had a chance they had the PGA tournament up in Indianapolis last year i was able to go and see one of the rounds of that and that was really fun
sw04443-B_017192-018063 i mean you knew it yeah i never really thought it was would be that much fun to go to a big golf tournament and watch but man it was it was something else just to follow those guys around and actually watch them_1 play
sw04443-B_018063-018703 [silence]
sw04443-B_018703-018817 right
sw04443-B_018817-019109 [silence]
sw04443-B_019109-019205 you got
sw04443-B_019205-019929 i mean it's uh it's a lot more exciting than actually w[atching]- w[atching]- than watching it on TV and if you pick a group of golfers and follow them_1 around i mean it's just
sw04443-B_019929-020848 watching them_1 the whole time instead of like on TV you get to see them_1 make a tee shot and then they go off to some other hole and they come back when they're putting but you know it's really something else
sw04443-B_020848-021031 [silence]
sw04443-B_021031-021212 uh i'm a student right now
sw04443-B_021212-021288 yeah

sw04443-B_022215-022327 [silence]
sw04443-B_022327-022930 [laughter-no] i wi[sh]- it'd be nice to be a pro golfer i mean it seems like that that would be an okay life just to hang out and
sw04443-B_022930-023034 [silence]
sw04443-B_023034-023155 [laughter-yeah]

sw04443-B_023910-024672 well you know you it seems like well you go to work every weekend play maybe one two tournaments a month and come in about tenth you'd still be doing pretty well
sw04443-B_024672-024831 [laughter-so]
sw04443-B_024831-024952 yeah

sw04443-B_027225-027327 yeah
sw04443-B_027327-027881 and those fees to join a club like a million dollars or whatever is just that is out of control
sw04443-B_027881-028253 i mean you'd really want to really be liking your golf
sw04443-B_028253-028580 [silence]
sw04443-B_028580-028925 yeah i [laughter-saw] [laughter-one] of those on TV that is pretty wild

sw04443-B_029957-029978 [noise]
sw04445-A_000000-000264 [noise] what kind of pollution do you have in Flagstaff
sw04445-A_000264-000651 [silence]
sw04445-A_000651-000784 uh-huh
sw04445-A_000784-003829 [silence]

sw04445-A_008922-009055 um-hum
sw04445-A_009055-010393 [silence]
sw04445-A_010393-011554 yeah well i i'm sure that cinder dust is pretty unique [laughter] um in the Dallas area of course the the biggest issue of air pollution is just automobiles
sw04445-A_011554-012701 uh we don't have much in the way of heavy industry i mean this is a center for electronics and banking and insurance and you know businesses like that
sw04445-A_012701-013024 which are not typically bad polluters [laughter]
sw04445-A_013024-013220 but um
sw04445-A_013220-013614 so i i'd think you'd have to blame most of it on the automobiles here
sw04445-A_013614-014794 [silence]
sw04445-A_014794-015190 we have we yes we occasionally have them not if they're not
sw04445-A_015190-015417 n[ot]- not too significant
sw04445-A_015417-016222 but they do occ[asionally]- occasionally occur uh one source of [laughter-pollution] for us is the dust and sand in uh west Texas
sw04445-A_016222-016715 in the spring time we'll have parts of Lubbock coming to Dallas
sw04445-A_016715-017123 i'm serious these enormous clouds
sw04445-A_017123-017421 of sand or dust or whatever you wanna call it
sw04445-A_017421-017749 [silence]
sw04445-A_017749-017891 uh-huh
sw04445-A_017891-018812 [silence]
sw04445-A_018812-018977 yeah [laughter]
sw04445-A_018977-019578 [silence]
sw04445-A_019578-019824 [laughter-okay]
sw04445-A_019824-020453 [noise] all right i can understand that it's interesting though that you mentioned the uh wood stoves
sw04445-A_020453-021460 i grew up in New Mexico and but that was long enough ago that uh people didn't really heat that much with wood that was sort of a backward way of doing things if you will
sw04445-A_021460-022158 uh but now in New Mexico heating with with particularly pinon pine is really an issue
sw04445-A_022158-022690 not only from the pollution point of view but it takes many many years to grow those trees
sw04445-A_022690-022807 [silence]
sw04445-A_022807-023224 and people are chopping them down and heating their houses with them um
sw04445-A_023224-023716 and it's it's such a distinctive smell when it burns i had forgotten it i mean i [laughter]
sw04445-A_023716-024308 it it's one of those smells you forget but then when you step outside your mother's house you go [oop/oops] yep somebody's burning [laughter-pinon]
sw04445-A_024308-024842 [silence]
sw04445-A_024842-024976 uh-huh

sw04445-B_000000-000281 [noise]
sw04445-B_000281-001348 well we have the the usual automotive pollution that and although it's not very visible you don't worry about that uh too much uh but uh
sw04445-B_001348-001546 we have a lot of wood smoke
sw04445-B_001546-002497 uh here now i heat with wood so ah and i'm one of the polluters if you think that wood smoke is a is a s[ource]- a source of pollution but there are people in this community who
sw04445-B_002497-002663 who think that uh
sw04445-B_002663-003212 it's gone beyond the part of being part of the charm of the community to the point of being part of the pollution
sw04445-B_003212-003343 [noise] and
sw04445-B_003343-003446 [silence]
sw04445-B_003446-003884 and uh we're very close to the uh to the Grand Canyon
sw04445-B_003884-004174 where air pollution is a very big issue
sw04445-B_004174-005601 because on of pollution well it's debatable as to whether it's coming from the Los Angeles area on the jet stream or whether it's coming from the Four Corners power plant up near Page Arizona uh
sw04445-B_005601-006938 but because it's a national park that's a a big issue there uh [noise] here in Flagstaff actually uh it it's something that's unique to us the the biggest pollutant that we have in our air is cinder dust
sw04445-B_006938-007379 and that's because uh we're in a volcanic region
sw04445-B_007379-008373 and we uh we have dirt roads uh in a lot of areas that are covered with with cinders but what they also cinders on the highways in the winter time
sw04445-B_008373-009821 in place of uh using salt or substances like that that they might in the eastern part of the country and when the snow goes away and it dries up and the cars drive over it we get a lot of cinder dust kicked up into the air and as of
sw04445-B_009821-010435 you know the lar[gest]- the largest quantity that's the biggest pollutants that we have t[o]- to deal with here
sw04445-B_010435-010725 [silence]
sw04445-B_010725-010900 yes [laughter]

sw04445-B_013117-013575 [silence]
sw04445-B_013575-014875 does does Dallas s[its]- sit in any kind of uh uh i've been there but i don't remember if you sit in any kind of a trough that uh where you get temperature inversions that that capture air pollutants or anything like that
sw04445-B_014875-016191 [silence]
sw04445-B_016191-016316 sure

sw04445-B_016889-017352 [silence]
sw04445-B_017352-018551 i laugh because i made the journey once from El Paso to Dallas and then continuing east uh to the Eastern Coast of the United States and uh i joked that uh all of the settlers
sw04445-B_018551-019770 settled in Eastern Texas where the green rolling hills are and and when they finally beat the Mexicans the Mexicans said fine you can have East Texas but as l[ong]- as long only as long as you take west Texas too [laughter]

sw04445-B_024260-025615 here in Flagstaff uh juniper is the the very distinctive smelling wood that you can smell in the wood smoke uh and one of the issues here ah it which gets into forest management but has an impact on on air pollution
sw04445-B_025615-026199 is that uh we're surrounded by the largest stand of ponderosa pine in the world
sw04445-B_026199-027060 but people don't wanna burn ponderosa pine they wanna burn oak which is very hard to find in this region or juniper because it's the more plentiful hardwood
sw04445-B_027060-027825 and uh aspen uh it burns very cleanly but doesn't put out a lot of heat uh and and ponderosa
sw04445-B_027825-028484 we also have pinon but uh it uh it it like ponderosa is very dirty
sw04445-B_028484-029138 and so they're not preferable woods and so here we have this great abundance of ponderosa pine
sw04445-B_029138-029895 and the forest service is real[ly]- saying we really wish that we could find a way to make it uh less of a

sw04448-A_008510-008843 like you said in awhile it's uh
sw04448-A_008843-009579 most of my favorite fishing was before i came in the service and that was trout fishing up in Wyoming
sw04448-A_009579-009730 [silence]
sw04448-A_009730-010301 and we went out to a lot of lakes and the streams and stuff and went fishing
sw04448-A_010301-010906 i did some fly fishing and stuff in the streams and tha[t]- that's pretty fun doing fly fishing
sw04448-A_010906-011259 [silence]
sw04448-A_011259-011798 a lot of most of the lakes up there have rainbow trout in them_1 or brook trout

sw04448-A_012589-012774 you know uh
sw04448-A_012774-014002 what if you got a pretty good if you know it has to be probably knee deep or a little deeper for you know in a creek before you can really do any good fishing
sw04448-A_014002-014160 [silence]
sw04448-A_014160-014446 a lot of times just fish from the bank
sw04448-A_014446-014743 um unless you get a good
sw04448-A_014743-015468 sp[ot]- spot in the corner you can kind of wade out a little bit but most of my fishing was done from the bank
sw04448-A_015468-015857 but it it was pretty fun uh
sw04448-A_015857-016487 i've caught a three four pound trout before and that's pretty good size trout [laughter]
sw04448-A_016487-016799 um i've caught some
sw04448-A_016799-017336 we got one reservoir up there that has some walleye in it

sw04448-A_021623-022573 yeah it it was it's pretty good though you know some of the bays are you know a little deep you know where they come in and stuff but
sw04448-A_022573-022767 uh
sw04448-A_022767-023016 it it was uh
sw04448-A_023016-023428 an experience you know because_1 he had his own boat
sw04448-A_023428-023530 [silence]

sw04448-A_029109-029246 yeah
sw04448-A_029246-029853 i've watched a lot of them sport fishing things on TV you know where they're out in the deep sea fishing
sw04448-B_000000-000380 [noise] actually i don't have much recent experience uh but
sw04448-B_000380-000487 [silence]
sw04448-B_000487-001457 i have done uh a variety of fishing probably the most favorite uh was when i was of youth
sw04448-B_001457-002163 um probably in the ages ten to fifteen when i went out with my dad uh we lived in
sw04448-B_002163-002660 we lived on the uh southeast coast of Florida about a mile from the ocean we went out
sw04448-B_002660-002945 off the coast of Fort Lauderdale Miami
sw04448-B_002945-003416 in uh small boat with a small outboard motor
sw04448-B_003416-003845 went out a mile two miles three miles sometimes and bottom fished
sw04448-B_003845-004127 and uh [noise]
sw04448-B_004127-004589 and got lots of fish very rapidly basically went out to a reef and uh
sw04448-B_004589-004736 which probably about
sw04448-B_004736-004843 [silence]
sw04448-B_004843-005180 oh ten fathoms or something like that and uh
sw04448-B_005180-005769 and we just pull up fish usually pull up fish as fast as you could let your line down
sw04448-B_005769-006509 and sometimes uh had some fun uh with trigger fish that would follow other fish up and then
sw04448-B_006509-006770 then you'd catch the trigger fish right at the surface
sw04448-B_006770-007353 occasional shark or an occasional octopus things of that nature but
sw04448-B_007353-007591 [silence]
sw04448-B_007591-008029 yeah well that was pretty rare you know but every once in a while you'd get something like that
sw04448-B_008029-009552 [silence]
sw04448-B_009552-009685 i see
sw04448-B_009685-010875 [silence]
sw04448-B_010875-011304 now where do you do uh trout fishing in Wyoming
sw04448-B_011304-011745 [silence]
sw04448-B_011745-012035 i see so you would fish in the lake
sw04448-B_012035-012381 and the fly fishing is in the stream or what
sw04448-B_012381-013656 [silence]
sw04448-B_013656-013798 um
sw04448-B_013798-013952 [silence]
sw04448-B_013952-014185 you fish from the bank or do you wade
sw04448-B_014185-015385 [silence]
sw04448-B_015385-015508 um
sw04448-B_015508-016361 [silence]
sw04448-B_016361-016505 oh yeah
sw04448-B_016505-017573 [silence]
sw04448-B_017573-017816 where abouts in Wyoming is this
sw04448-B_017816-018124 [silence]
sw04448-B_018124-018281 i see
sw04448-B_018281-019727 [silence]
sw04448-B_019727-019954 where abouts is this
sw04448-B_019954-021076 i see that's quite different from the east coast the the the uh gulf coast uh you have to go out like maybe ten or twenty miles before you get more than knee deep almost
sw04448-B_021076-021718 whereas on the east coast uh you go out a mile and you're already uh five ten fathoms down
sw04448-B_021718-022414 [silence]
sw04448-B_022414-022559 hm
sw04448-B_022559-023208 [silence]
sw04448-B_023208-023577 so what did you what did you get there off Sarasota
sw04448-B_023577-024300 [silence]
sw04448-B_024300-024445 [noise]
sw04448-B_024445-024546 [silence]
sw04448-B_024546-024757 have you ever been sport fishing
sw04448-B_024757-024877 [silence]
sw04448-B_024877-025658 i'd like to do that sometime i've never been sport fishing the closest i've come is to is uh go out on party boats drift fishing
sw04448-B_025658-026448 yeah which is pretty nice we did that in New Jersey not too many years ago and uh did it just at the right time and we got into
sw04448-B_026448-027214 just schools and schools of blue fish big ones about they each one weighed about ten pounds
sw04448-B_027214-027611 you know they were about like uh three four feet long
sw04448-B_027611-027724 [silence]
sw04448-B_027724-028843 oh yeah yeah that was really uh rea[lly]- i guess they may be about three feet long not four but u[m]- um that was something they really fought like
sw04448-B_028843-029161 you like n[othing]- nothing else i'd ever had
sw04448-B_029161-029773 [silence]
sw04448-B_029773-029853 hm
sw04467-A_000000-000137 [noise] the best to do
sw04467-A_000137-000280 for voting
sw04467-A_000280-001416 [silence]
sw04467-A_001416-001645 [laughter]
sw04467-A_001645-001751 [silence]
sw04467-A_001751-002140 one of the biggest stumbling block is at first getting registered
sw04467-A_002140-006063 [silence]
sw04467-A_006063-006402 isn't that what you have now in Oregon you have the booklets
sw04467-A_006402-006591 [silence]
sw04467-A_006591-006900 yep and each uh party or whatever
sw04467-A_006900-007157 against or for the proposition or
sw04467-A_007157-011312 [silence]
sw04467-A_011312-011414 excuse me
sw04467-A_011414-011681 [silence]
sw04467-A_011681-011900 oh well that yeah
sw04467-A_011900-013560 [silence]
sw04467-A_013560-013696 uh-huh
sw04467-A_013696-014149 yeah i- i- i understand to giving pros and cons and being informed but
sw04467-A_014149-014781 i thinking also uh you can you should have voter registration by phone things like that
sw04467-A_014781-014882 [silence]
sw04467-A_014882-015846 yeah well y[ou]- you know a lot of places do it by mail but a lot of people don't but you know get to the step of putting it into the mail you know and uh
sw04467-A_015846-016454 if you can do it from the phone and pick it up at anytime twenty four hours a day and do it that's that'll make
sw04467-A_016454-016563 [silence]
sw04467-A_016563-016721 well
sw04467-A_016721-016883 [silence]
sw04467-A_016883-017776 well actually there's there are ways i mean if they can get the speaker identity verification and those kind of technologies out there it would help um
sw04467-A_017776-018596 you know in terms of verifying who they are and what they're saying and and uh you know people could uh use that you know
sw04467-A_018596-019768 [silence]
sw04467-A_019768-019981 where do you live yeah
sw04467-A_019981-020474 and all that stuff yeah they don't do that which is a problem and uh
sw04467-A_020474-021685 i don't know i think um that or you can also the problem is also oh motivating people to do it seeing that their voting has an impact on the process and people frankly don't see
sw04467-A_021685-022833 any connection with what they they vote and what happens so they very frustrated and they don't do anything so there's learned helplessness type of you know no matter what i do it's not gonna help so why bother
sw04467-A_022833-022968 um
sw04467-A_022968-024378 [silence]
sw04467-A_024378-024505 um-hum
sw04467-A_024505-025238 [silence]
sw04467-A_025238-025910 um-hum well they sh[ould]- i you know what i think also they should do is build in the process the election process
sw04467-A_025910-027178 is not just vote getting i mean to get those pe[ople]- candidates saying that not that their votes aren't any good unless they also motivate so many percent of the populace to vote they could be identified by them
sw04467-A_027178-027281 [silence]
sw04467-A_027281-028025 so put it in the political process that that you know not only you have to get petitions in order to get on the ballot
sw04467-A_028025-028836 but you have to attract you know you have to attract so many people just to come to vote they don't have to vote for you but they have to come to the polls and actually vote
sw04467-A_028836-029872 you know those something built in to the system to motivate people to to bring them into the process and especially the people who wanna hold office i mean that's what
sw04467-B_000000-000049 [noise]
sw04467-B_000049-000227 [silence]
sw04467-B_000227-000475 well i think that uh
sw04467-B_000475-000650 [silence]
sw04467-B_000650-000804 i guess i ju[st]-
sw04467-B_000804-001488 everybody knows that education is is important but i guess the main thing is there's some things you just don't care about
sw04467-B_001488-001811 so if you don't care about them_1 you don't vote for them_1 right
sw04467-B_001811-002168 [silence]
sw04467-B_002168-002919 yeah although although uh that's there's a lot of people out there that'll do that for you that
sw04467-B_002919-004179 i just thought of something now that that made a big difference to me and uh come to think of it it's got to do with Jerry Brown and that's when i was in i used to live in California and when he was Secretary of State there
sw04467-B_004179-004812 one of the things that he did was he sent out a booklet and the booklet was
sw04467-B_004812-006141 uh here are the issues here's the pros here's the cons here's the pro rebuttal to the cons and here's the con rebuttal to the pros by the time i got through reading that article by the time i got through reading that booklet i knew exactly what the issues were
sw04467-B_006141-006337 [silence]
sw04467-B_006337-006684 well we had a little booklet and it says here's the issues
sw04467-B_006684-007093 [silence]
sw04467-B_007093-008058 but for fifty bucks you can or whatever it is fifty or three hundred or five hundred or something like that you can put in a statement for or against
sw04467-B_008058-008380 but the nice thing about this other thing was that
sw04467-B_008380-008496 and
sw04467-B_008496-008804 was that you have uh
sw04467-B_008804-010139 like i say you have the people say well it's going to uh it's gonna reduce taxes and the other people say yeah it'll reduce taxes but at the expense of something else and so it was how shall i say it it was kind of focused pros and the cons and then the rebuttal
sw04467-B_010139-010643 a[nd]- so i got to see both sides whereas in the current booklet it just says here's
sw04467-B_010643-011226 uh if somebody thinks it's a good idea he tells me but you know it's are you uh are you involved in software
sw04467-B_011226-011346 [silence]
sw04467-B_011346-011712 are you an engineer or or involved in software at all
sw04467-B_011712-011814 [silence]
sw04467-B_011814-012558 okay well one of the things about a lot of programs is they tell you what they do but they don't tell you what they don't do
sw04467-B_012558-013856 and the only way you know what i mean they say oh look this is great this this s[lices]- slices bread but they don't tell you that [noise] that it also mashes it at the same time and uh so that
sw04467-B_013856-014073 [silence]
sw04467-B_014073-014230 yeah
sw04467-B_014230-014699 [silence]
sw04467-B_014699-015084 well out here they do it by uh mail you can do it by mail that
sw04467-B_015084-016324 [silence]
sw04467-B_016324-016557 well the problem with that i think is fraud
sw04467-B_016557-016896 we haven't been around voter fraud uh too much but
sw04467-B_016896-018514 [silence]
sw04467-B_018514-019937 or the other option i guess is to i mean why do you even have to do it over the phone why couldn't you just walk up to the booth and and uh register right there and then they have with uh everything hooked up by the computer you could say okay you've already voted
sw04467-B_019937-022756 [silence]
sw04467-B_022756-023103 [laughter] [laughter-that's] that's certainly true too
sw04467-B_023103-023582 there's uh the other side of the coin is that uh in the educational side
sw04467-B_023582-024458 the IRS does a wonderful job right about now at putting articles in the paper about uh motiva[ting]- motivating people to turn in their taxes
sw04467-B_024458-024740 uh and i don't think the

sw04474-A_000955-001336 my circumstance dealt with kids who were in school
sw04474-A_001336-002175 and i thought that that was probably more difficult to deal with because finding someone who would fill those small time slots
sw04474-A_002175-002925 early in the morning and after school what you were left with were uh high school girls or boys
sw04474-A_002925-003414 and uh never mind that they had all those noble
sw04474-A_003414-004587 uh qualities like you know you know the same philosophy of raising [laughter-children] that you did you were probably lucky to get anybody because you weren't paying them very much and uh it was just a short period of time so
sw04474-A_004587-005428 uh it was really kind of someone who would sit and watch TV with them it it wasn't the kind of thing that you would get involved in if you had small children and
sw04474-A_005428-005909 you had child raising thoughts in mind it was kind of a temporary
sw04474-A_005909-006352 um babysitting kind of thing have you dealt with that
sw04474-A_006352-007520 [silence]
sw04474-A_007520-007796 oh are you pleased with the situation

sw04474-A_013622-014122 [silence]
sw04474-A_014122-014819 you said you have a couple of changes do the kids get attached to one person and then it's a problem to wean them off them
sw04474-A_014819-015957 [silence]
sw04474-A_015957-016144 how old are the kids
sw04474-A_016144-017545 [silence]

sw04474-A_019166-019996 uh-huh have you ever discussed with your caretaker how you want your children raised what your philosophies are

sw04474-A_026129-026902 you know you really are in such desperate need and if your child's sick there's the panic it's like i can't stay home what do i do
sw04474-A_026902-027829 and you know you import grandma from the other town to come over it was an emergency you know Christmas vacation comes around and then you've got to fill in that block of time

sw04474-B_008827-009780 and prior to that we had you know to take child care we took the kids to somebody else's home and that worked out okay but it wasn't that great
sw04474-B_009780-009884 [silence]
sw04474-B_009884-010129 well we you know it was just
sw04474-B_010129-011177 it was partly the convenience and partly you know the woman the women that took care of our kids also had kids of their own and [noise] the households were a little hectic you know how it sometimes is
sw04474-B_011177-012541 [silence]
sw04474-B_012541-013176 oh yes definitely without a doubt i'm [noise] you know it's like having a a
sw04474-B_013176-013494 a young adult in the family just about
sw04474-B_013494-014103 but that's okay i mean y[ou]- you know as long as as their problems don't get too far out of hand [noise]
sw04474-B_014103-014261 well
sw04474-B_014261-014782 [silence]
sw04474-B_014782-015711 a little bit of a problem but you know that's just reality of it and you know you have to work with them and tell them ahead of time that somebody's leaving and somebody else is gonna be coming in
sw04474-B_015711-015989 and help them adjust to the situation
sw04474-B_015989-016093 [silence]
sw04474-B_016093-016915 oh the youngest is three and the oldest is nine and the middle one is six and the after -[s]chool school situation is great it's really convenient to have
sw04474-B_016915-017617 somebody whose job it is to make sure they're that they get home and and you know are taken care of properly
sw04474-B_017617-017864 [silence]
sw04474-B_017864-018475 oh yeah [laughter] it it's expensive it'll it'll probably have to change when they get

sw04474-B_019227-019433 but it

sw04474-B_020973-021714 she and the and the caretaker have intense discussions about that and i suppose i'm
sw04474-B_021714-022130 sort of a slug for not getting more involved but that's the way [laughter-it] [laughter-is]
sw04474-B_022130-022517 [silence]
sw04474-B_022517-023174 oh it works out pretty well i think it's a good plan um i think it's kind of disgraceful that it's so hard for so many people

sw04474-B_027716-028185 [noise] oh we've got those situations and you know we've got to deal with that kind of stuff but
sw04474-B_028185-028897 but it's absolutely you know situation like ours you know where we could make enough money to cover it properly
sw04474-B_028897-029754 you know both we both work and then we pay the pay the nanny and we pay the comp[ensation]- workers compensation insurance and we pay the the withholding taxes we

sw04483-A_000113-001442 [silence]
sw04483-A_001442-001975 well they just kicked it off down here in in Sarasota county um
sw04483-A_001975-003387 [noise] they had been doing it they started first in Sarasota City um you know which makes up a pretty small portion of the county actually and um they've got these i don't know what if you're familiar with Sarasota county at all
sw04483-A_003387-004529 they've got these on it's it's county wide program now and what they've done is they've broken everything down into garbage uh yard trash
sw04483-A_004529-004831 plastic c[ans]- cans and glass
sw04483-A_004831-005139 and then uh paper
sw04483-A_005139-006120 which in the paper it's just um newspaper and corrugated cardboard is the only thing you're supposed to put in there no slicks um

sw04483-A_009804-010559 okay and um and and she's just Shaklee crazy you know because it's her business and everything and um
sw04483-A_010559-011918 [noise] you know and she asked we were talking one day and and she asked me a couple of questions you know and she and and what she said that that generally the problems that people have with being environmentally conscious is number one
sw04483-A_011918-013292 they don't want it to change their lifestyle and and like you know especially make it anymore complicated or any extra work or anything which that's that's what recycling at home sorting does you know i mean it's a little extra work and uh
sw04483-A_013292-013890 it can actually turn out to be a lot of extra work because what they do what they do here in Sarasota county is they've got
sw04483-A_013890-014718 okay you put your garbage in a garbage bag and you set it out by the curb if you have yard trash you put your yard trash in some kind of container
sw04483-A_014718-016078 um or you can have bundles up to a certain weight and cer[tain]- certain dimensions tie them_1 up and put them by the curb well the plastic cans and glass they give you this little tub and it's about a foot and a half deep and it's about one by one and a half foot wide and long
sw04483-A_016078-016744 this is a little container and they have another one the same size that one's red and then they have a blue one the same size for the paper goods
sw04483-A_016744-016981 and so like
sw04483-A_016981-018047 you know you would have to rinse out your pop cans otherwise you got bees and ants and you know and and if you've got uh food containers or anything like that it's a big problem so not only do you
sw04483-A_018047-018166 yeah
sw04483-A_018166-018668 [silence]
sw04483-A_018668-018796 um-hum

sw04483-A_028707-029613 so i'm listening to that i kind of got an idea that i thought would be good was and this kind of fits into the uh the aid program the welfare program that's going on right now
sw04483-A_029613-029792 and it's like um [vocalized-noise]
sw04483-B_000000-000975 [noise] um anyway we're supposed talk about recycling basically what what your personal opinion is on it uh this is this is really for a speech research project they're doing
sw04483-B_000975-001475 so um i don't know Florida is pretty good about recycling isn't it
sw04483-B_001475-001770 [silence]

sw04483-B_006480-007430 okay see that's something in Minneapolis they're really strict on in terms of you got to put everything in its own little bag and really presort it really
sw04483-B_007430-008424 you know tightly but when i lived in Orlando it's like you could put almost anything in there and they'd just sort it out for you [laughter] it was really pretty good if you're lazy like i am so

sw04483-B_018715-019657 so it's like if if you use a lot of stuff you it's like well you know let's say if you're a partying kind of guy and you drink you know like a couple of twelve packs maybe over the weekend
sw04483-B_019657-020345 it's gonna be hard pressed to p[ressed]- to put all your recyclables in that one place you know so it's kind of a pain in the butt
sw04483-B_020345-021677 but um i don't know that's definitely one thing they could do to make it easier is to just you know have have those garbage people that make how every many make tw[enty]- twenty or thirty bucks an hour have them do a little bit of the sorting
sw04483-B_021677-022146 you know and and maybe come up with a better system make it a little more convenient

sw04488-A_024709-024872 if i'm
sw04488-A_024872-025900 or i can imagine somebody being outraged at something and saying uh i just i want to go for the gun i know where it is it's easy and then
sw04488-A_025900-026313 pulling the trigger is so easy that uh
sw04488-A_026313-026453 [silence]

sw04488-B_000039-000249 [silence]
sw04488-B_000249-001334 where do i stand well if uh if ten means absolutely no control i don't think i'd buy that but i guess i'd be maybe a six
sw04488-B_001334-001989 i think that we probably should have a right to own guns if we're responsible
sw04488-B_001989-002142 uh
sw04488-B_002142-002623 i myself own one i shoot nothing but paper targets
sw04488-B_002623-003120 but i don't think anybody has the right to tell me i can't possess one i don't think
sw04488-B_003120-003460 uh if i'm responsible my kids can't get a hold of them
sw04488-B_003460-004299 and i certainly wouldn't use them for a crime i think the people who do use them_1 for crime aren't the people who bother to get a a license
sw04488-B_004299-004501 uh what are your feelings
sw04488-B_004501-005549 [silence]
sw04488-B_005549-005806 yeah i i[t]- it is a uh
sw04488-B_005806-006130 just picking it out of a hat um
sw04488-B_006130-006475 but do you feel that no one should be able to own any
sw04488-B_006475-010655 [silence]
sw04488-B_010655-011197 okay well i don't know what the laws are in your state uh in order to get a license
sw04488-B_011197-011845 i was uh thoroughly checked out it took over seven months to get myself approved
sw04488-B_011845-012641 um you need all kinds of references you nee[d]- they check your criminal [laughter-record] and all this other stuff uh they restrict
sw04488-B_012641-013347 um when you can carry it you can just take it to a range and back home again if you want to hunt you need a special hunting license
sw04488-B_013347-014517 um i myself am no fool i didn't want to hurt myself why would [laughter-anybody] want to take a chance it is a dangerous thing i took a uh National Rifle Association course on
sw04488-B_014517-015136 how to uh handle one i keep it locked i keep the bullets somewhere else
sw04488-B_015136-016220 um i personally feel that if someone came into my house i'd be too much of a nervous wreck to shoot them accurately and i wouldn't want to hit my kids in case they were wandering around so i really have no
sw04488-B_016220-017094 no thought to use it for protection i you know i'm m[ore]- more of the notion that a bad guy is meaner than i am and would use it against me
sw04488-B_017094-017966 um i think the guns that are out there hurting people are held by irresponsible people um i don't believe that there should be
sw04488-B_017966-018661 that you should be able to walk into your local [laughter-supermarket] and buy one i mean any bozo [laughter-could] get one then and then it would be indeed scary
sw04488-B_018661-018814 [silence]
sw04488-B_018814-018900 uh
sw04488-B_018900-019024 [silence]
sw04488-B_019024-019928 i you know i just like the sport of shooting at a target it's the ki[nd]- it's sort of like weight lifting it's something that you can judge yourself against yourself
sw04488-B_019928-020112 and uh
sw04488-B_020112-021138 i- i- i agree that the thought of actually putting a bullet into flesh is really [laughter-revolting] i mean i personally can't even see hunting you know i have no use for Bambi [laughter-there]
sw04488-B_021138-021346 [silence]
sw04488-B_021346-022189 right but i mean w[e]- we get hamburger in a package and then we end up we forget it came from an animal but i choose to forget i'm a hypocrite [laughter-myself]
sw04488-B_022189-022272 [silence]
sw04488-B_022272-022371 uh
sw04488-B_022371-023109 what what would you think of the notion of you know just taking up a gun for target practice if you were trained d[oes]- does that revolt you in any way
sw04488-B_023109-023515 [silence]
sw04488-B_023515-023625 uh-huh
sw04488-B_023625-023818 did you feel unsafe

sw04488-B_026082-026526 [silence]
sw04488-B_026526-026862 well you know i[t]- i think it's i[t]- i[t]- i think
sw04488-B_026862-028058 uh you talk to someone else they say yeah i think everybody should have a g[un]- i should have a gun and [laughter-nobody] [laughter-else] [laughter-should] because i know i would [laughter-act] [laughter-responsibly] but you you never know about the other guy and i think that's part of the reason why people a[re]- are so fearful
sw04488-B_028058-028386 because it's true someone might get drunk and not think
sw04488-B_028386-028546 um
sw04488-B_028546-029049 you know i don't believe in no laws i think that would be a scary kind of thing
sw04488-B_029049-029347 but well that's how i feel
sw04488-B_029347-030000 [silence]

sw04493-A_004122-004583 [silence]
sw04493-A_004583-005055 well now there's there's multiple kinds of country western music uh
sw04493-A_005055-005401 not that i'm an expert in that uh area but
sw04493-A_005401-005493 but there's

sw04493-A_007925-008387 now is is uh [vocalized-noise] i guess the other thing that that uh
sw04493-A_008387-008814 there there is one kind of music that i don't know i wouldn't consider it country western but
sw04493-A_008814-008996 but it is in a sense
sw04493-A_008996-009283 and that's bluegrass what about that
sw04493-A_009283-010163 [silence]
sw04493-A_010163-010273 okay
sw04493-A_010273-010528 did you watch the the

sw04493-A_012222-012331 [silence]
sw04493-A_012331-012497 it's not offensive to you is what i'm
sw04493-A_012497-012994 oh th[at's]- that's interesting my uh there for uh a long time uh
sw04493-A_012994-013101 [silence]
sw04493-A_013101-013732 i i liked folk music but uh folk music is you know a a back in the seventies
sw04493-A_013732-014019 so to speak sixties and seventies and then
sw04493-A_014019-014706 and uh then i became a a bluegrass fan and i listened to it all the time and i've got lots of tapes of it and then
sw04493-A_014706-015432 uh i like but i'm kind of like you i i i mean in some ways i'm like you i i don't uh
sw04493-A_015432-016775 uh i don't like [noise] music that it's this uh [noise] where you where you know what the next phrase is going to be because you know they have these dumb rhymes like a lot of i mean the where the how shall i say it the words are just so predictable
sw04493-A_016775-017316 and although i do laugh at some of the country western things they have this one uh country western
sw04493-A_017316-018000 song about the guy the perfect country western song and he said it had to have trains and all that stuff trains and mama i don't know if you've heard that one
sw04493-A_018000-018297 [silence]
sw04493-A_018297-018962 and then he uh basically said okay so i went back to him and finally i[t]- what he came up with was the song about
sw04493-A_018962-019258 uh his mom got hit by a train and
sw04493-A_019258-020564 and uh sh[e]- or it was the day she got out of jail she got hit by a train and and things like that [laughter] [laughter-so] you know and anyways went to see her in his pickup truck and stuff like that so it was kind of creative i like that but uh
sw04493-A_020564-020974 [laughter-yeah] but uh
sw04493-A_020974-021705 the thing one of the things that that the northwest i've been told has has got a lot of uh it's kind of the center of activity is uh
sw04493-A_021705-022209 uh i don't know if you would call it new wave music or or uh new age music i is that it
sw04493-A_022209-022630 yeah George Winston and which is he's a little bit uh
sw04493-A_022630-023168 uh well he's kind of the recognized [noise] uh i don't know if he's the founder of it but
sw04493-A_023168-023288 but they

sw04493-A_025035-025629 how shall i say it it's very predictable now that's interesting you'd say the air pudding some people would call it yuppie music
sw04493-A_025629-028797 [silence]
sw04493-A_028797-030029 [noise] the i i can respond to that a little bit by uh i spent three years in the Far East and of course the some of the i mean what kids

sw04493-B_000063-000173 [silence]
sw04493-B_000173-000782 oh by all means various types um my tastes range from
sw04493-B_000782-001124 rock and roll to classical
sw04493-B_001124-001666 in fact about the only type of music that i really find offensive would be uh country western
sw04493-B_001666-001784 [laughter-yeah]
sw04493-B_001784-001961 [silence]
sw04493-B_001961-002358 i take that back rap but i consider rap music to be an oxymoron

sw04493-B_005247-005381 yeah
sw04493-B_005381-006407 well there was rockabilly in the fifties and that's what gave rise to like Carl Perkins uh Jerry Lee Lewis uh Elvis Presley in the beginning
sw04493-B_006407-006690 and that type of music i do appreciate
sw04493-B_006690-007292 it had some it had it had the spark of creativity it was it was out there
sw04493-B_007292-007943 and uh since then it's sort of fallen into formula and i guess that's my thing is i have a problem with formula music
sw04493-B_007943-008823 [silence]
sw04493-B_008823-008900 huh
sw04493-B_008900-009255 [silence]
sw04493-B_009255-010228 well i've only been exposed to that minimally and that's usually through occasional you know viewings of concerts of said type on public television

sw04493-B_010346-010783 [silence]
sw04493-B_010783-011269 oh it was something i had basically for background it was not uh obtrusive

sw04493-B_023039-023158 [silence]
sw04493-B_023158-023459 yeah it's like the Windham Hill stuff it's it's
sw04493-B_023459-023846 yeah it's uh new age classical so to speak
sw04493-B_023846-024212 well what i what i often uh call air pudding yeah
sw04493-B_024212-025352 [silence]
sw04493-B_025352-025543 yeah
sw04493-B_025543-026238 yeah well i only use it when i'm studying and that's the extent of it it's just it's good background filter stuff
sw04493-B_026238-026832 [noise] and you know it what it is it's pleasant but it's not
sw04493-B_026832-027478 talent in in my view it's not genius um when i really wish to get into
sw04493-B_027478-028364 listening pleasure uh with something of that nature i put on Mozart or Beethoven something that will evoke a response
sw04493-B_028364-028623 something that almost reaches in an[d]- and
sw04493-B_028623-028828 hits those proverbial heart strings
sw04493-B_028828-029651 [silence]
sw04493-B_029651-029751 uh
sw04493-B_029751-030029 [silence]
sw04495-A_000000-000264 [noise] i haven't done any camping lately how about_1 you
sw04495-A_000264-001496 [silence]
sw04495-A_001496-001885 [noise] were these extended trips or just a weekend or
sw04495-A_001885-002389 [silence]
sw04495-A_002389-003415 uh that's about what i've done but it goes back even further to my childhood camping went out camping a[nd]- a[nd]- the purpose was not to camp the purpose was to fish
sw04495-A_003415-003855 and there were no motels in in the wilds of New [laughter-Mexico]
sw04495-A_003855-004858 [noise] so if you wanted to go fish for a few days you would uh and at certain lakes that were definitely off the beaten track you would do what you i think what you call car camping
sw04495-A_004858-005521 i mean the car's there and and you may or may not sleep on a cot outside of it or inside the car or
sw04495-A_005521-005990 but uh nothing too elaborate in the way of tents and
sw04495-A_005990-006390 i've actually even slept on the ground [laughter]
sw04495-A_006390-007579 [silence]
sw04495-A_007579-007869 [noise] where did you do your backpacking
sw04495-A_007869-009217 [silence]
sw04495-A_009217-009647 but this was in years past or yeah
sw04495-A_009647-010948 [silence]
sw04495-A_010948-011383 [vocalized-noise] around Philmont or something [laughter]
sw04495-A_011383-012022 no i haven't no but every Boy Scout i've ever known has camped at [laughter-Philmont]
sw04495-A_012022-012563 [silence]
sw04495-A_012563-013149 yeah i guess i don't know do you think i[t's]- it's as safe as it used to be to go camping [noise]
sw04495-A_013149-015597 [silence]
sw04495-A_015597-016599 yeah when when i was in growing up in New Mexico if we went on a picnic or whatever it was always in the mountains we lived in the southwestern corner of the state so we could go to the mountains or the desert
sw04495-A_016599-017114 just pick a place and if you w[ere]- needed water the you'd find a stream and drink right out of the stream
sw04495-A_017114-018033 when i left New Mexico and moved to Missouri i would not have dreamed [laughter] drinking out of any stream that i saw [laughter-there]
sw04495-A_018033-018488 so i guess partly it depends on on how isolated the river is
sw04495-A_018488-019476 but uh course i- i mean even in in New Mexico you always had the possibility of a cow or uh some other critter upstream a [laughter] ways from you
sw04495-A_019476-019578 [silence]
sw04495-A_019578-020082 um what about crime in camp sites do you think that's a problem
sw04495-A_020082-022131 [silence]
sw04495-A_022131-022284 yeah
sw04495-A_022284-022915 [silence]
sw04495-A_022915-023720 oh yeah yeah it you hide your fishing gear and your camera and all that sort of [laughter-stuff] don't tempt people
sw04495-A_023720-024783 [silence]
sw04495-A_024783-024942 [laughter]
sw04495-A_024942-025176 that's right
sw04495-A_025176-025687 i have a good friend who goes backpacking about twice a year in the Grand Canyon
sw04495-A_025687-026095 he's he's really uh hung up on that [laughter-Grand] [laughter-Canyon]
sw04495-A_026095-027752 [silence]
sw04495-A_027752-027915 yeah
sw04495-A_027915-028741 yeah i- i think with the c[ase]- like in the case of the canyon you see more from the rim than you would ever c[amping]- camping down [laughter-inside] [laughter-of] [laughter-it]
sw04495-A_028741-029339 [noise] yeah are there mountains in Wisconsin for you to go out and climb or
sw04495-A_029339-029731 [silence]
sw04495-B_000000-000050 [noise]
sw04495-B_000050-000243 [silence]
sw04495-B_000243-001512 oh not recently we we've done a little bit of car camping [noise] uh since since i got married and did a little bit of backpacking several years ago but uh not recently
sw04495-B_001512-001893 [silence]
sw04495-B_001893-002439 well not real long maybe three four days at the most how about_1 you
sw04495-B_002439-002834 [silence]
sw04495-B_002834-002966 um-hum
sw04495-B_002966-003360 [silence]
sw04495-B_003360-003481 um-hum
sw04495-B_003481-004774 [silence]
sw04495-B_004774-004912 right
sw04495-B_004912-005736 [silence]
sw04495-B_005736-005872 um-hum
sw04495-B_005872-006289 [silence]
sw04495-B_006289-007203 yeah well i've done a little bit of that too um i guess i've kind of done the full range of camping anywhere from backpacking in the mountains for
sw04495-B_007203-007623 for a week at a time to the the car camping kind of thing
sw04495-B_007623-007859 [silence]
sw04495-B_007859-008630 well i've done some down in um Tennessee and Kentucky that area North Carolina and then done some in New Mexico
sw04495-B_008630-008976 and some out in Montana Colorado
sw04495-B_008976-009287 so i've kind of gone around and done it number of places
sw04495-B_009287-009458 [silence]
sw04495-B_009458-009605 right
sw04495-B_009605-010730 i used to work at um summer camps um a lot when i was in high school and college and i worked at some summer camps in New Mexico where um
sw04495-B_010730-011144 the emphasis there was on backpacking exclusively
sw04495-B_011144-011471 right um-hum you've been there
sw04495-B_011471-011573 [silence]
sw04495-B_011573-011689 um-hum
sw04495-B_011689-011947 [silence]
sw04495-B_011947-012616 yeah yeah well it's a very popular place and i worked there [noise] three summers so [noise] got to know it pretty well
sw04495-B_012616-013136 [silence]
sw04495-B_013136-013751 well probably the biggest concern that i would have now is getting safe drinking water um
sw04495-B_013751-015044 cause a lot of times we'd just pull water out of a stream and um use that and i was never really big on using a lot of chemicals for water purification and treatment um
sw04495-B_015044-015656 and nowadays i think i'd be a little bit more cautious about that than i used to be
sw04495-B_015656-017057 [silence]
sw04495-B_017057-017201 um-hum
sw04495-B_017201-017929 [silence]
sw04495-B_017929-018066 right
sw04495-B_018066-018408 [silence]
sw04495-B_018408-018530 um-hum
sw04495-B_018530-019415 [silence]
sw04495-B_019415-019558 um-hum
sw04495-B_019558-020084 [silence]
sw04495-B_020084-020706 well i suppose in some of the real big parks and stuff that could be an issue
sw04495-B_020706-021560 but generally i haven't ever found that to be a problem usually people are very friendly and
sw04495-B_021560-022313 um cooperative all the way around so i've never deemed that as a threat to myself but
sw04495-B_022313-023009 been been fairly careful about_1 not leaving tempting things out in the campsite and stuff like that
sw04495-B_023009-023455 [silence]
sw04495-B_023455-023604 um-hum
sw04495-B_023604-024340 right and usually if i'm backpacking of course there i don't worry about it much at all because_1 if
sw04495-B_024340-025058 there's something there that they want [noise] they'd have to haul it out a long ways so they usually would think twice about it
sw04495-B_025058-025206 so
sw04495-B_025206-025616 [silence]
sw04495-B_025616-025744 um-hum
sw04495-B_025744-026076 [silence]
sw04495-B_026076-026799 you know i've had some friends of mine that have made the trip down through there a couple of times they really enjoy it but
sw04495-B_026799-028006 there's something about going down in a hole that [laughter] just um doesn't really relate that strongly to me i suppose i'll try it someday but i always like to climb mountains and get up where i can see something
sw04495-B_028006-028642 [silence]
sw04495-B_028642-028781 um-hum
sw04495-B_028781-029214 [silence]
sw04495-B_029214-029731 well no it's mo[re]- mostly just some rolling hills so there isn't really much
sw04497-A_000000-000098 [noise]
sw04497-A_000098-001117 well all right um i- i guess i'll start um by mentioning that um being twenty four years old i had a great-grandmother
sw04497-A_001117-001859 who's still alive at this point who was just recently placed in a nursing home after the death of my great-grandfather
sw04497-A_001859-002582 and it was a real problem [noise] in doing that because uh she has Alzheimer's
sw04497-A_002582-003546 and uh she had no wish or desire to go into that kind of facility and uh we were very concerned about uh
sw04497-A_003546-004500 her long-term care my great-grandfather after he was found out he was going to go into a nursing home uh actually gave up the ghost more or less
sw04497-A_004500-004908 and passed on o[nly]- only about a week after that
sw04497-A_004908-011631 [silence]
sw04497-A_011631-011814 um-hum
sw04497-A_011814-011963 [noise]
sw04497-A_011963-013890 [silence]
sw04497-A_013890-014038 yeah we[ll]-
sw04497-A_014038-014260 [noise] we had
sw04497-A_014260-015433 yeah we had up here when they got into uh when my grandmother came over my great-grandmother came over here she actually spent sometime with us and we had to have a nurse come in
sw04497-A_015433-016786 because we simply we couldn't handle it she kind of she'd lost all bearings as to where she was and she would actually wander around uh we were afraid she would wander herself into the basement and fall down the stairs or
sw04497-A_016786-017915 uh you know it was incredible because my great-grandfather had taken care of her and she demanded absolute twenty four hour care she had to be watched she had to be cleaned
sw04497-A_017915-018686 everything you know it was a demeaning process for my for my grandfa[ther]- great-grandfather we had never realized how much
sw04497-A_018686-019899 um how bad she had deteriorated over the uh years i mean i she would forget my name and she would forget you know how to cook or how to take care of herself but we didn't realize the extent
sw04497-A_019899-020218 until after my great-grandfather had a bad stroke
sw04497-A_020218-021045 and um um [vocalized-noise] we had her here and we had to take care of her and it even kind of drove the nurse a little [laughter-crazy]
sw04497-A_021045-021196 [silence]
sw04497-A_021196-021332 [noise]
sw04497-A_021332-022109 [silence]
sw04497-A_022109-022255 yeah
sw04497-A_022255-023838 [silence]
sw04497-A_023838-023989 yeah
sw04497-A_023989-025195 [silence]
sw04497-A_025195-026299 yeah my my great-grandfather my great-grandfather had found uh my great-grandfather w[as]- w[as]- was around during the depression so he had actually hidden a lot of money in the house over there
sw04497-A_026299-026826 and of course you know the moment you go into a nursing home situation they take everything
sw04497-A_026826-027576 and and it was it was terrible and very demeaning he didn't wanna lose the independence and
sw04497-A_027576-028530 uh that was the biggest problem because we didn't really catch it as early as you seem to have as far as you know planning you know of long-term
sw04497-A_028530-029599 [silence]
sw04497-A_029599-029786 yeah
sw04497-B_000000-000093 [noise]
sw04497-B_000093-002462 [silence]
sw04497-B_002462-002698 um-hum um-hum
sw04497-B_002698-004448 [silence]
sw04497-B_004448-004595 hm
sw04497-B_004595-004925 [silence]
sw04497-B_004925-005178 [noise] well my um [noise]
sw04497-B_005178-005507 my my grandmother is um
sw04497-B_005507-006754 had Alzheimer's and through the process we had to remove we tried to keep her at home at our we had to remove her from her home because she was getting paranoiac and tried to keep her at our home and [noise]
sw04497-B_006754-007236 did that as long as we could but again the process is very difficult even
sw04497-B_007236-008325 e[ven]- you know i think that my parents did a good job at it when when they went through but it's not an easy thing when they've got Alzheimer's but my other grandparents
sw04497-B_008325-008748 [noise] um signed up for a retirement
sw04497-B_008748-009465 type thing in Pennsylvania um already my father's much older than my mother so
sw04497-B_009465-010041 well no i guess it anyway my grand[parents]- my other grandparents are much younger and um
sw04497-B_010041-010517 they what they did is they sold their house and bought a house
sw04497-B_010517-011174 figuratively speaking in this retirement complex and they live in that house
sw04497-B_011174-012297 and there there there's minimal because they you know they bought it um they've kind of bought into the whole system and there's there's care given for the lawn and stuff
sw04497-B_012297-013414 and um as they get older more care can be given and there's some minimal fees that they'll always be paying but the basic fee for health care and all that is already taken care of
sw04497-B_013414-013906 and when they get too old they can move into an apartment instead it's like a duplex they have now
sw04497-B_013906-014313 they can move into an apartment and then later nursing
sw04497-B_014313-015376 [silence]
sw04497-B_015376-015524 um-hum
sw04497-B_015524-016794 [silence]
sw04497-B_016794-016905 yeah
sw04497-B_016905-020993 [silence]
sw04497-B_020993-022407 [noise] yeah that's what happened to my other my grandmother my grandfather had died and she wanted to stay on and then she got Alzheimer's and it was a really hard thing for the whole family i'm much more appreciative of what my
sw04497-B_022407-023524 my other set of grandparents has done and my parents have already um kind of like gone on a waiting list cause it's such a long thing because it preserves the dignity
sw04497-B_023524-024647 of the you know the whole situation and it's a decision that my parents have made and it won't be a drain on our resources because it'll mean just
sw04497-B_024647-025186 um you know sell selling their house now and buying into that at the same time
sw04497-B_025186-025450 and it's familiar
sw04497-B_025450-026769 [silence]
sw04497-B_026769-026925 um-hum
sw04497-B_026925-027512 [silence]
sw04497-B_027512-027656 yeah
sw04497-B_027656-028451 [silence]
sw04497-B_028451-028913 [noise] well we didn't catch it for my first grandmother my first set of grandparents
sw04497-B_028913-029786 but my other grandparents had apparently it's like a retirement community and they knew a lot of friends who had done the same thing and when they got there [noise]
sw04501-A_000000-000112 [noise] let's see i kn[ow]-
sw04501-A_000112-000494 i can guess i know what the rules are in Washington DC
sw04501-A_000494-000737 [silence]
sw04501-A_000737-001386 [vocalized-noise] but on the other hand in in uh Virginia it's supposed to be close to wide open right
sw04501-A_001386-001644 [silence]
sw04501-A_001644-002636 so i'm uh and i'm well i'll give you a clue i've if if guns caused crime there would be a lot of crime in Virginia and not much in DC
sw04501-A_002636-003072 [laughter] but [laughter-uh]
sw04501-A_003072-003532 [laughter] on a scale i guess i'm about a nine and a half
sw04501-A_003532-004209 so i've let's see s[o]- ten means what ten means no controls and one means uh
sw04501-A_004209-004538 one means total restrictions i guess i'm
sw04501-A_004538-004775 i'm about uh
sw04501-A_004775-005415 yeah i've i'm between nine and a half and ten i'm i'm not saying no control but uh
sw04501-A_005415-005646 but uh
sw04501-A_005646-006004 [laughter] yes i have been since uh
sw04501-A_006004-006545 you know i[t's]- it's one of those things where they say uh that you're biased you're uh you['re]- you're uh
sw04501-A_006545-006697 [silence]
sw04501-A_006697-007236 you're a member and so then the question comes up uh well if you really believed in it why wouldn't you be a member
sw04501-A_007236-007549 but anyway i uh
sw04501-A_007549-008047 let's see okay now so y[ou]- tell me where you are in the scale then
sw04501-A_008047-008165 [silence]
sw04501-A_008165-008597 you're about a five you think sometimes it's right and sometimes it's wrong huh
sw04501-A_008597-008867 [silence]
sw04501-A_008867-009003 it
sw04501-A_009003-009281 well it's i know it can be uh
sw04501-A_009281-009863 it can be kind of scary the idea of just everybody wandering around with uh uh
sw04501-A_009863-010772 you know absolute no limits or anything like that on the other hand the truth is that all the bad guy[s]- let me put this way all the guys that i'm scared of already have it
sw04501-A_010772-010924 [silence]
sw04501-A_010924-011510 and uh and uh uh when John Lennon got uh nailed
sw04501-A_011510-011734 shot [laughter] i should say
sw04501-A_011734-011987 uh one of the
sw04501-A_011987-012587 some some of my friends were saying you know that's another argument for gun control i said oh yeah he should have lived in in uh
sw04501-A_012587-012997 he should of have lived in in uh Ireland
sw04501-A_012997-013544 where they have a total [laughter-ban] you know in northern Ireland yeah tha[t]-
sw04501-A_013544-014129 [silence]
sw04501-A_014129-014256 but
sw04501-A_014256-014981 the reason when i say i was really talking about northern Ireland you know because in northern Ireland there is a lot of crime and it's totally bann[ed]-
sw04501-A_014981-015442 and uh th[e]- uh the uh
sw04501-A_015442-015905 how do i say this the uh the thing that i have noticed
sw04501-A_015905-017113 with uh this topic is that that i know some very intelligent people and i- i say well here's a little brochure why don't you read this and see what it says i don't want to read that okay and uh
sw04501-A_017113-017899 where as i'm the other way i'll read i can read about when i say i'm the other way that's not to say i'm open minded uh as much as i think i am
sw04501-A_017899-018069 but i'll read anything
sw04501-A_018069-018254 [laughter]
sw04501-A_018254-018802 and uh try and and pick it apart so uh let's see what was the other thing i was going to say uh
sw04501-A_018802-019000 [silence]
sw04501-A_019000-019565 now my earlier statement about if if they caused crime then Virginia should have a lot of them_1
sw04501-A_019565-020234 should have a lot of crime uh i don't know that that kind of reflects my my feeling about it because you notice the states
sw04501-A_020234-020669 where they claim all of these things are coming from they don't have a very high crime rate
sw04501-A_020669-020831 and
sw04501-A_020831-020960 [silence]
sw04501-A_020960-021070 yeah
sw04501-A_021070-021697 [silence]
sw04501-A_021697-022539 yeah well the th[e]- the thing that i see is it's not the availability because availability is you know cocaine is is is outlawed too but
sw04501-A_022539-023546 bu[t]- but it's the uh it's the nature and and my feeling if you go back to England uh England is one of those places where they have relatively low rates
sw04501-A_023546-023906 but also the rates of other crimes are lower
sw04501-A_023906-024965 and the other thing that happens is they also have the ability to stop you and say uh mister you look like a pickpocket would you please empty your pockets
sw04501-A_024965-025639 and if you try that here in the States i mean you could unload f[our]- four pounds of dynamite and uh
sw04501-A_025639-025990 you'd walk because they they're not allowed to ask you
sw04501-A_025990-026513 so it's it's kind of like uh dandelions i don't know if you have any if do you own a house
sw04501-A_026513-026745 well anyway if you had a lawn
sw04501-A_026745-026860 uh uh if you
sw04501-A_026860-027049 if you've ever had a lawn
sw04501-A_027049-028252 if you've ever had a lawn uh and somebody says uh wait till the place is full of dandelions and then go try and and pull the heads off as fast as you can you'd be pulling heads off all day you know of of dandelions
sw04501-A_028252-029378 and whereas in England where they come u[p]- they come up to a kid and they say uh you look like you've got a problem and he says i don['t]- no i don't and then they say well uh let's go they can even go to your apartment and uh
sw04501-A_029378-029923 force you to open your apartment and anything they find in there is used as evidence so the result is that uh

sw04502-A_005553-005742 they'll pardon him or
sw04502-A_005742-006171 it hardly ever gets to that point uh i don't think they've done one
sw04502-A_006171-006811 in a long time but i know it's legal and i know one just about happened recently but it never went through
sw04502-A_006811-007309 so they try but you know very few actually go

sw04502-A_015226-015909 um well i can i can vouch for the fact that the uh the appeals will go through and go through and go through
sw04502-A_015909-016685 and yeah it drags on for about forever you know i guess i'm about your your opinion of it i have nothing against it philosophically
sw04502-A_016685-017685 in terms of if you're absolutely sure i mean uh uh i- i would feel that you better make sure it's one of those cases that has virtually no possibility of
sw04502-A_017685-018804 n[o]- you know you you pretty i mean supposedly you get through the courts you're not supposed to have any reasonable doubts anyway but i guess it would have to be one of those extremes in the first place but there's enough of them
sw04502-A_018804-019415 but i i've also heard that that these things cost so much in the end that uh
sw04502-A_019415-020698 that it really doesn't [laughter-save] [laughter-you] any money if it's a money thing and as a deterrent thing i don't really think uh personally i don't feel that capital pun[ishment]- punishment as a deterrent is a is a big deal i don't think that really works that much

sw04502-A_027300-027735 [noise] a lot of things going on down here all the Gainesville murders
sw04502-A_027735-028901 course i don't think they've they that then actually down here there's b[een]- mo[re]- more publicity going on on pol[ice]- police screw ups and and uh
sw04502-A_028901-029776 beatings and everything than than actual [laughter-murders] and uh the Gaine[sville]- with the Gainesville picking up people seemingly
sw04502-B_000000-000122 [noise] like it

sw04502-B_000251-000620 [silence]
sw04502-B_000620-001996 well Governor Mario the uh holy one [laughter] up here Mario Cuomo has been against capital punishment since he hit office here i'd say six years ago he's
sw04502-B_001996-002665 he's for the concept of um uh life in prison without parole
sw04502-B_002665-003980 and every single year up in here in New York state the uh gov[ernment]- the state assembly gets together and tries to pass a death penalty bill and every year he vetos it [laughter] and upsets people
sw04502-B_003980-004712 yeah he upsets people up here um every time he does it i don't what it is down in Florida these days
sw04502-B_004712-007233 [silence]
sw04502-B_007233-007608 yeah Mario up here is claiming that um
sw04502-B_007608-008197 the reason why he's against capital punishment is because to send these [vocalized-noise] things through the court system
sw04502-B_008197-009084 on appeal then another appeal then another appeal ends up costing the taxpayers more than just putting the guy away for the rest of his life with no chance of parole
sw04502-B_009084-009423 so you know i[f]- i[t]- if it comes down to a money issue
sw04502-B_009423-010229 i you know in that case then i'm all for putting them_1 behind bars as long as there's no chance of parole but you know what it's like when they
sw04502-B_010229-011069 yeah they fill the court th[ere]- the jails up and suddenly let them_1 go and they're back on the street we had this murder up here
sw04502-B_011069-011595 um Art Shawcross up in Rochester killed nineteen prostitutes up here
sw04502-B_011595-011977 and he was let out on parole from up in uh
sw04502-B_011977-012275 um Watertown and

sw04502-B_012389-012547 [silence]
sw04502-B_012547-013015 uh he was just well actually he it was on purpose i guess
sw04502-B_013015-014148 he was uh he was a real psycho though and uh as a matter of fact it this happened under Cuomo's watch so the Bush administration was thinking if Cuomo is going to run for President they were gonna do instead of
sw04502-B_014148-014608 yeah instead of Willie Horton now we have the Art Shawcross deal [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw04502-B_014608-015324 [noise] s[o]- so yeah i don't know what your feelings are about it being in Florida where you've had it before
sw04502-B_015324-020635 [silence]
sw04502-B_020635-021217 yeah well of course you know we have New York City up here i'm in being in Rochester we're kind of
sw04502-B_021217-021722 they consider us more in Canada [laughter-than] [laughter-in] [laughter-New] [laughter-York] [laughter-State] [laughter-area]
sw04502-B_021722-022634 but uh up here you know we have we don't have too many serious problems with crime but i know in New York City it was a real it's a big deal they would like to have it back
sw04502-B_022634-023274 and uh [noise] i think it's gonna boil down to changing the governor if they really wanna put it through
sw04502-B_023274-023823 uh they're building more prisons up here to try and put people in Attica is not too far away
sw04502-B_023823-024657 from where we are and that's at capacity and of course you know New York City is just packed with criminals that have done everything
sw04502-B_024657-025159 so i you know i don't where it's going to go to in the end i just think that um
sw04502-B_025159-026044 i- i- i agree with you i'm not really that terribly against it as long as it looks like it's going to work and reduce the court load and [noise]

sw04503-A_006274-006687 [silence]
sw04503-A_006687-007866 well apparently in your state there's more incentive to send your child to pub[lic]- uh to a private school because in New York you pay taxes for public schools and then if you wanna send your child to private school you pay again

sw04503-A_010575-011385 right i don't i don't have any experience myself with private schools so i really can't say they're better i did go to public schools
sw04503-A_011385-012131 and what i'm finding um right now i have two kids and i'm going back to work and i'm substitute teaching in public schools
sw04503-A_012131-012880 and what i see in the high school is i don't know that it's public private i think times have changed
sw04503-A_012880-013519 i mean i know that i would never not do my homework because lightning would strike me something terrible would happen
sw04503-A_013519-014522 but nowadays the kids don't do their work and they have the nerve to say to you so what are you gonna do and you're not gonna do anything
sw04503-A_014522-014709 but you
sw04503-A_014709-015607 yeah i think the most important thing that a public school can do to help the problem is to
sw04503-A_015607-016729 to maybe go backwards in some ways um i find the teachers trying to be like the kids uh telling their k[ids]- i teach art and they'll go yeah that's cool well
sw04503-A_016729-017932 maybe they should talk like grown-ups and the kids should learn to act like grown-ups instead of the [laughter-grown-ups] trying to act like the kids to get their acceptance i find the teachers are very concerned about being liked
sw04503-A_017932-019167 [noise] being being friends with them and you know they don't wanna be so strict they don't wanna be so hard on them and i find that the kids are not turning in quality work because there's nothing to impress upon them that they better
sw04503-A_019167-019463 and you know the k[ids]-
sw04503-A_019463-021237 [silence]
sw04503-A_021237-021609 [noise] well maybe they'll make them [vocalized-noise]
sw04503-A_021609-022201 well you know yeah well maybe they'll make them_1 stay home for a day but that's no [laughter-torture] [laughter-for] [laughter-a] [laughter-kid]
sw04503-A_022201-022447 [laughter]
sw04503-A_022447-023560 yeah and i know kids if they you know if they're late enough often enough they get a letter home and they get to the mail box before their parents because their parents work so you know it's not a problem and i find that you know
sw04503-A_023560-023838 [silence]
sw04503-A_023838-024346 um yeah well they they sent me yes that's true it progress reports
sw04503-A_024346-026207 [silence]
sw04503-A_026207-026437 oh sure they [laughter]
sw04503-A_026437-027570 yeah they never have homework they always did it in school i have a fourteen year old son who is just getting into you know realizing that he can dupe me [laughter-i] [laughter-think]
sw04503-A_027570-028552 but i- i think the the public school it's not that the teachers are inferior or that the materials are inferior i think what's going on is that
sw04503-A_028552-029628 the teachers have to be backed up when the kids don't do what they're supposed to do um the teachers have to have some way to
sw04503-A_029628-029786 they need the paren[tal]-
sw04503-B_000000-000298 [noise]
sw04503-B_000298-001693 okay well i have one child that's in public schools now i have three children that went to a private school and then we put them into public school system and i think we did them a big disservice by putting them in public schools
sw04503-B_001693-002779 um i think that they my child now is in public school and we're getting ready to put her into a private school because of it i just don't feel like they're they're getting enough out of it you know for
sw04503-B_002779-003686 yes yes i just don't think that academically they're and the school systems here is supposed to be really good they have i don't know if you're familiar but Texas has uh
sw04503-B_003686-004233 oil money that finances their school system you know there there's no state taxes paid here
sw04503-B_004233-005116 so the money from the taxes from the oil go to pay go towards the schools and running of the schools so they're supposed to have a really good program but uh
sw04503-B_005116-006149 i don't know i just feel like my daughters are in college now and the last three years their life they went to public school and they made straight As and they're really struggling in college now
sw04503-B_006149-006918 and uh i think that it has a lot to do with it i d[on't]- i don't i don't know where where you can fix it [laughter] you know what you need
sw04503-B_006918-007791 [silence]
sw04503-B_007791-008778 yes well you do that here too you pay higher uh property taxes for the area that you're living in depending on the schools and the area you're in
sw04503-B_008778-009648 no it it supplements the schools that for therefore there's no state income tax that goes towards uh the school systems
sw04503-B_009648-010782 because of that you know because of that but the property taxes that you have on your home depending on what area you are you know like they're higher in certain areas than they are in other areas you know but uh
sw04503-B_010782-012043 [silence]

sw04503-B_020239-021292 you know i mean because_1 in public schools these people really don't have any authority to do anything or to really punish these kids in any way i mean they can't even hardly give them_1 detention you know without
sw04503-B_021292-021845 having to call their parents [laughter-and] [laughter-have] [laughter-their] [laughter-parents] [laughter-come] [laughter-in] [laughter-and] [laughter-all] this kind of stuff i mean it really is a major thing

sw04512-A_003467-003945 if do you think there's gonna be enough excitement that we'll have more people voting
sw04512-A_003945-006477 [silence]
sw04512-A_006477-006609 yeah
sw04512-A_006609-006772 [silence]
sw04512-A_006772-007824 well i- i don't know i- i think in terms of uh the national elections the election later this year since Perot is from Dallas and if he gets on the
sw04512-A_007824-008418 uh ballot i think there w[e]- that we will have the larger percentage of voter turnout than usual
sw04512-A_008418-009194 but i- i think it's pathetic that only half of the people in the country that are eligible tend to vote in the national elections
sw04512-A_009194-010269 i and i think it represents uh malaise due to well my vote doesn't count it doesn't matter anyway it's it's really i think it's more of a problem in the local elections
sw04512-A_010269-012809 [silence]
sw04512-A_012809-013343 i it's it's too bad i you have more control over your local politicians
sw04512-A_013343-013951 [silence]
sw04512-A_013951-014599 easier to get a hold of [laughter] it's eas[ier]- they're easier to get a hold of it's not a long distance call for one thing [laughter]

sw04512-A_018261-019947 [silence]
sw04512-A_019947-020950 well i- i think in your case college students in general pretend not to pay that much attention to the local politics i think they've got enough going on [laughter]
sw04512-A_020950-021192 that's not a part of your world
sw04512-A_021192-021375 [silence]
sw04512-A_021375-021730 campus elections are more important [laughter-i] [laughter-suppose]
sw04512-A_021730-022067 [silence]
sw04512-A_022067-022387 but there there's voter apathy there isn't there

sw04512-A_027754-029114 [silence]
sw04512-A_029114-029376 some of us i think do it out of habit

sw04512-B_001320-002436 [noise] uh Clinton and uh uh Brown of course yeah and then uh i don't know if you've heard much about this this other guy the independent Perot
sw04512-B_002436-003457 he may be drawing off some uh Republican votes and uh so it seem like George Bush has completely locked up the Republican although i think i don't
sw04512-B_003457-003670 i guess he has but
sw04512-B_003670-003936 [silence]
sw04512-B_003936-005154 uh i don't know i think that's i think that's hard to say i know uh Clinton and Brown are both trying to go after wh[at]- whatever the block vote whatever that's supposed to be and uh
sw04512-B_005154-006480 i don't know i- i think it'll be interesting i know a a lot of people have you know are are starting to feel are are more you know with the re[cession]- uh recession and everything i think a lot more people are starting to uh become more politically actively i mean
sw04512-B_006480-006777 i th[ink]- i think there will be more why what do you think

sw04512-B_011315-012326 uh like the deficit people who don't who don't really care about stuff like that really don't have any clues to what's going on like right under right in their own towns or counties or
sw04512-B_012326-012839 state or whatever so yeah i agree with you yeah i think people are even you know

sw04512-B_014249-015141 exactly sure yeah and i mean most of them are even you know you'll see them_1 you know you know however many times a year i mean they're actually in your city
sw04512-B_015141-015753 you know in your neighborhood or whatever but uh yeah i yeah yeah it is interesting how that works and people just i don't know they just
sw04512-B_015753-015888 [silence]
sw04512-B_015888-016599 uh yeah yeah yeah i do vote uh i know if i when i first registered uh
sw04512-B_016599-017877 i guess with the last election uh i was uh in my late teens so i only really registered and voted for the uh who was that then that was uh Dukakis and uh
sw04512-B_017877-018617 uh yeah Dukakis and Bush i guess it was the last time that was i guess that was the first presidential election i voted in but uh
sw04512-B_018617-019081 [noise] at that time i was really apolitical i mean you know that
sw04512-B_019081-019729 [vocalized-noise] and like you said about uh local uh govern[ment]- or local uh politics i was just
sw04512-B_019729-020006 you know not in in touch at all

sw04512-B_023987-024840 uh arena of politics i don't even see uh you know any kind of influence or anything or any you know
sw04512-B_024840-025043 uh
sw04512-B_025043-025900 um but uh yeah federally defi[nitely]- i- i think people should everybody should be you know uh should definitely be uh
sw04512-B_025900-026567 uh aware of uh you know the presidential elections they should be you know uh
sw04512-B_026567-026944 yeah yeah they should they should participate uh you know

sw04512-B_027477-028536 um yeah [vocalized-noise] yeah b[ut]- but but i- i- i think it'll be interesting to see you know uh i think the people that vote are the people who um
sw04512-B_028536-029105 jeez n[ow]- now that's hard to say it's hard to say who votes and and why um
sw04512-B_029105-029334 [silence]

sw04519-A_000362-002414 [silence]
sw04519-A_002414-002941 well i have to say i really don't have a budget
sw04519-A_002941-003872 both my wife and i uh grew up in uh families of rather modest means and uh
sw04519-A_003872-004809 our family income at this point is comfortable upper middle class i guess you might say and uh we're both so
sw04519-A_004809-005053 uh frugal
sw04519-A_005053-006358 that um we really don't need a budget you know we just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem to have any money problems which i guess is a comfortable thing
sw04519-A_006358-006794 [silence]
sw04519-A_006794-007497 well we stay within our means but we don't do it uh by conscious effort it just sort of happens automatically
sw04519-A_007497-008440 although we just moved to California and uh the cost of living here in California is um i would say rather pathological [laughter]
sw04519-A_008440-009326 uh housing prices are you know like from four to ten times more expensive than um
sw04519-A_009326-010464 um they were where i came from in uh Dallas [noise] yeah so uh
sw04519-A_010464-011739 uh that presents um a real shock [laughter] actu[ally]- actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we've moved to California but
sw04519-A_011739-012001 [silence]
sw04519-A_012001-012750 yeah it's God's country uh and one way you know that is that only God can afford it [laughter]
sw04519-A_012750-013482 um so budget is not a problem for us
sw04519-A_013482-014421 uh least it hasn't been it may it may be at this point but uh up until this point it really hasn't been when i uh was in uh
sw04519-A_014421-015719 undergraduate school a long long time ago i uh noted that the monthly salary starting average monthly [saly/salary] salary for engineers that [vocalized-noise] in my discipline was like
sw04519-A_015719-016567 oh six hundred and ten dollars a month or something like that and uh i noted at that point that i was
sw04519-A_016567-017791 you know if that's what my salary was that i drew then i would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever so
sw04519-A_017791-018352 i stopped worrying about money and uh never have worried about money since then
sw04519-A_018352-018682 [silence]
sw04519-A_018682-020181 sometimes uh it's a bit of a a problem you know because i guess i don't really manage my money the way i should but uh i suppose i've lost money on not taking good advantage of of uh investments but
sw04519-A_020181-020978 [silence]
sw04519-A_020978-021205 um-hum
sw04519-A_021205-023086 [silence]
sw04519-A_023086-023700 well i guess we're both lucky in that regard then
sw04519-A_023700-023939 uh how big is your family
sw04519-A_023939-024131 [silence]
sw04519-A_024131-024300 i see
sw04519-A_024300-024819 [silence]
sw04519-A_024819-025274 so how do you and when once you get ten children though you may have

sw04519-A_025391-025680 oh all right [laughter]
sw04519-A_025680-026942 i have two kids uh one nine and one thirteen and they are beginning to be a budget problem but uh have not been really up until this up to this point
sw04519-A_026942-027872 i give them_1 uh i give them_1 an allowance and they um i basically give my son ten dollars a week and i put
sw04519-A_027872-028370 half of it in the bank and i give give him the other half in cold cash
sw04519-A_028370-029548 and uh he has a teller card so he can uh do what he wi[shes]- do what he wishes with the money that i put in the bank but at least it isn't you know burning a hole in his pocket
sw04519-A_029548-029907 if he wants to use it he has to go get it and that usually

sw04519-B_000048-000300 [silence]
sw04519-B_000300-000933 oh i- i start okay well uh we keep a budget to an extent um
sw04519-B_000933-001778 and really i[t]- i[t]- we were really forced into keeping a budget because i'm i'm paid once a month which sort of sort of forces some uh
sw04519-B_001778-002298 uh restrictions and you need to make sure all your bills are paid
sw04519-B_002298-002546 uh how about_1 yourself
sw04519-B_002546-006253 [silence]
sw04519-B_006253-006885 yeah well i guess that really is sort of of keeping a budget you know you stay within your uh
sw04519-B_006885-007090 within your means
sw04519-B_007090-007427 [silence]
sw04519-B_007427-007577 yeah
sw04519-B_007577-008370 [silence]
sw04519-B_008370-008551 yes
sw04519-B_008551-010044 [silence]
sw04519-B_010044-010548 oh you moved from Dallas to San Francisco that is a huge difference
sw04519-B_010548-011112 [silence]
sw04519-B_011112-011283 yeah
sw04519-B_011283-011682 [silence]
sw04519-B_011682-012159 but you have good sour dough and it's a beautiful [laughter-place] to live
sw04519-B_012159-012372 yeah
sw04519-B_012372-012605 [silence]

sw04519-B_018654-020123 [silence]
sw04519-B_020123-021071 well then again you know you said you you are able to take trips and you do obviously have enough to live on so i guess you're indirectly budgeting
sw04519-B_021071-021907 uh just by by the fact you said that you're both very frugal uh in spending the money so i mean that's that's a form of budgeting i would think
sw04519-B_021907-022198 [silence]
sw04519-B_022198-023113 it's kind of a kind of a strange topic to to [laughter-try] [laughter-to] for two people who don't really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money
sw04519-B_023113-023553 [silence]
sw04519-B_023553-023704 yeah

sw04522-B_001117-001578 [silence]
sw04522-B_001578-001712 how long ago was that
sw04522-B_001712-002044 [silence]
sw04522-B_002044-002120 okay
sw04522-B_002120-002349 [silence]
sw04522-B_002349-002743 yes but that was uh okay so that was fairly recent and even then
sw04522-B_002743-003132 a lot of the conditions i think you're right they haven't improved that much
sw04522-B_003132-003749 [silence]
sw04522-B_003749-004030 yeah um-hum yeah the
sw04522-B_004030-004328 [silence]
sw04522-B_004328-004409 yeah
sw04522-B_004409-005197 [silence]
sw04522-B_005197-005268 huh
sw04522-B_005268-005375 [silence]
sw04522-B_005375-005467 sounds tough
sw04522-B_005467-005735 [silence]
sw04522-B_005735-005797 yeah
sw04522-B_005797-006553 [silence]
sw04522-B_006553-006640 right
sw04522-B_006640-007115 [silence]
sw04522-B_007115-007206 uh-huh
sw04522-B_007206-007924 [silence]
sw04522-B_007924-008248 oh yeah that's that [laughter] doesn't seem right does it [laughter]
sw04522-B_008248-008599 [silence]
sw04522-B_008599-008698 yeah
sw04522-B_008698-009310 i you know you walk into one of those places and you basically start to feel depressed because they don't
sw04522-B_009310-009992 a lot of places don't have a good atmosphere they're ju[st]- it's almost like they just shove people in there and wait for them to die
sw04522-B_009992-011051 you know and it's it's really it's a bad problem uh i work at Honeywell up here and i was talking to a guy that's actually working toward mobility aids for handicap people
sw04522-B_011051-012174 and one of the things he's done is interview uh nursing home directors because they're looking for [laughter] get this they're trying to find out ways to restrain patients
sw04522-B_012174-013387 so that they don't look like they're restrained because apparently the family members who come to visit get upset understandably upset when they see that their loved one is in restraints you know
sw04522-B_013387-014288 uh at the same time you have to restrain him because they might hurt themselves they might stand up and not be able to to stay stood up or might fall down or whatever
sw04522-B_014288-014914 so it's an interesting problem that's just one of the many things that you know you have to think about in a nursing home
sw04522-B_014914-015466 but you know the stuff that you told me is there's no excuse for that you know
sw04522-B_015466-016941 [silence]
sw04522-B_016941-017315 right stuff when they're not on their guard you know
sw04522-B_017315-018495 [silence]
sw04522-B_018495-019211 oh sure you know it's it's really a good idea to look at places and see what's out there and see what th[e]- the modes of treatment are
sw04522-B_019211-019429 and and how people act
sw04522-B_019429-020035 [silence]
sw04522-B_020035-021132 yeah you know it really is you know that brings up a good point i've got a friend of mine up here and we were talking about this because his father is getting to the age where they're going to have to decide what to do and
sw04522-B_021132-022002 he brought up a real interesting suggestion that works well for families that have a lot of kids in it like i co[me]- i come from a family that has five kids
sw04522-B_022002-022289 well the way he said it was
sw04522-B_022289-022453 our parents
sw04522-B_022453-023509 spent you know quite a bit of time when we were young taking care of us you know call it call it three years per child now if you have five children that's fifteen years total
sw04522-B_023509-024468 therefore shouldn't it be right that they should be able to stay with one family member uh in a rotating fashion for fifteen years free of charge
sw04522-B_024468-024737 there you go it it's essentially repayment
sw04522-B_024737-025332 [silence]
sw04522-B_025332-026421 yeah that's it but the thing is hold on i got one more thing and i'll let you talk [laughter] because_1 we started talking about that you know we started saying well you know some family members might not agree to do that
sw04522-B_026421-027700 and he said fine let the one who does agree to do it keep him keep the f[ather]- keep the father or mother for a longer time and charge the family member who doesn't cooperate just say basically look
sw04522-B_027700-028330 uh i'll take care of mom and dad for you but you have to give me a kind of a payment for doing that for you
sw04522-B_028330-028693 you know so essentially it it relieved them of the burden
sw04522-B_028693-028800 uh
sw04522-B_028800-029374 and at the same time everybody kind of comes out happy i don't know if that would work but then again it it depends on the family size
sw04522-B_029374-029555 [silence]
sw04522-B_029555-029773 yeah uh-huh
sw04522-B_029773-029991 [silence]
sw04523-A_000000-000047 [noise]
sw04523-A_000047-000610 so uh i i guess it's subject is uh gun control
sw04523-A_000610-001837 [silence]
sw04523-A_001837-002007 um-hum
sw04523-A_002007-004375 [silence]
sw04523-A_004375-005166 um-hum yeah i sort of believe the same way i think i'm i'm probably considered more of a conservative but i still think that uh
sw04523-A_005166-005514 uh with regards to gun control the
sw04523-A_005514-006259 uh like convicted felons you know they shouldn't be able to have one um also i'm in
sw04523-A_006259-007177 if i[f]- if you look at it uh like say a waiting period i'm in favor of a waiting period as just that a waiting period before
sw04523-A_007177-008424 someone buys a a handgun and like i say a week or two weeks as a cooling off period but uh i- i guess the uh NRA they kind of look at it as a springboard towards more restrictive gun controls and
sw04523-A_008424-009006 so i can kind of see both both sides o[f]- of the of the uh issue on that
sw04523-A_009006-009571 [silence]
sw04523-A_009571-009734 um-hum
sw04523-A_009734-010541 [silence]
sw04523-A_010541-010729 yeah um-hum
sw04523-A_010729-011119 [silence]
sw04523-A_011119-011258 yeah
sw04523-A_011258-012821 [silence]
sw04523-A_012821-012995 uh-huh
sw04523-A_012995-013955 [silence]
sw04523-A_013955-014109 uh-huh
sw04523-A_014109-014620 [silence]
sw04523-A_014620-015700 yeah that that is true um as a as a toy you know i mean if you call a gun a toy they would be it would be interesting to have one shoot one but uh
sw04523-A_015700-016206 but you're right there's no no real legitimate need for one unless you consider
sw04523-A_016206-016362 um
sw04523-A_016362-017122 like personal defense like if your home or something that's it's kind of extreme i- i don't personally own one but uh
sw04523-A_017122-017510 it's it's really it really is a touchy issue i know uh
sw04523-A_017510-017947 the uh like you mentioned the plastic handguns the Glock
sw04523-A_017947-019033 it seems to me like like that that weapon they could it s[eems]- it seems to me like they could bypass all the i- i think the um the major concern is is that they think
sw04523-A_019033-019991 that it can be slipped through airport security like it it say invisible X rays seems to me like technically that'd be very simple to solve just put some sort of a
sw04523-A_019991-021304 uh a metal f[lake]- flake or something that would show up on on X rays you know it to show the outline of the gun and then you'd still have the advantages of the gun which is i believe light weight and uh it would
sw04523-A_021304-022590 [silence]
sw04523-A_022590-022790 uh-huh
sw04523-A_022790-025488 [silence]
sw04523-A_025488-025659 um-hum
sw04523-A_025659-026530 [silence]
sw04523-A_026530-027839 [laughter] [laughter-yeah] [noise] [laughter] yeah it's uh the [laughter-NRA] they're uh they're almost a little too radical in the other extreme i'm i'm i'm pretty strong in favor of of personal gun ownership
sw04523-A_027839-028579 but they uh they might even [laughter-get] [laughter-a] [laughter-little] [laughter-carried] [laughter-away] you know with the lobbying and and whatnot but
sw04523-A_028579-028807 ye[ah]- yeah
sw04523-A_028807-029598 [silence]
sw04523-A_029598-029751 uh-huh
sw04523-A_029751-029869 [silence]
sw04523-B_000000-000162 [noise]
sw04523-B_000162-000739 [silence]
sw04523-B_000739-001689 yeah i um probably would put myself on a um five or six scale being up here in the uh northeast um
sw04523-B_001689-003035 i'm considered liberal [laughter] but uh i believe in the right to own and uh have a gun for yourself if that's what if that's what you want as long as you don't have a record
sw04523-B_003035-003950 in the past of um committing crimes or uh something in that order i think that it's important that there be some check
sw04523-B_003950-004520 um background checks before they just hand a gun over to any old person
sw04523-B_004520-008742 [silence]
sw04523-B_008742-009352 yeah absolutely you know th[at's]- that's the one concern that uh i have too is that
sw04523-B_009352-010659 you know once you go down the path and you start with first it's it's background checks and and uh then it's suddenly age restrictions and then it's totally illegal [laughter]
sw04523-B_010659-011508 and you know i- i come from up here i'm not in New York City area by any means so i'm in a a Rochester's not heavy crime area
sw04523-B_011508-012220 but um you know and i and it's been a political issue up here um a a big deal about whether or not
sw04523-B_012220-012944 they should people should have access to handguns and uh some of these Saturday night specials and plastic handguns and
sw04523-B_012944-014033 all of these new things i think pretty much up here everybody agrees that [noise] there should be more control on semiautomatic slash keeping automatic weapons banned
sw04523-B_014033-014946 um just because you know what kind of legitimate hunting use can you do with an AK-47 [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] [laughter]
sw04523-B_014946-017781 [silence]
sw04523-B_017781-017973 yeah
sw04523-B_017973-020981 [silence]
sw04523-B_020981-021149 yeah
sw04523-B_021149-022235 yeah up here you know we have a lot of hunters up here if you go just to the south of uh Rochester here you have a bunch of state parks and there's a lot of hunting that goes on and uh
sw04523-B_022235-022695 that i think is by far the majority of people that own guns around here
sw04523-B_022695-023316 tend to either be hunters or they live in the inner city and they're concerned about um uh their safety
sw04523-B_023316-024007 um we've had up here the NRA's main focus up here has been on protecting the hunting
sw04523-B_024007-025147 uh the people who are doing a lot of hunting because being not a large urban area like New York City where you have an NRA movement that's more um attuned to personal protection
sw04523-B_025147-025973 versus hunting um that's pretty much how they've gone about it up here and some of the tactics i mean i noticed they changed their commercials
sw04523-B_025973-027222 um used to be [laughter-they'd] [laughter-mention] [laughter-and] with every membership you get fifty thousand dollars dismemberment [laughter-insurance] [laughter]

sw04523-B_028303-028480 [silence]
sw04523-B_028480-029869 well it's a powerful lobby i mean i've debated issues um on some other issues regarding the cable TV and that and uh the NRA lobby is the most powerful that's up there in Capitol Hill and uh they do a number
sw04526-A_000000-000138 [noise] all right do you have any
sw04526-A_000138-000362 uh strong feelings on schools
sw04526-A_000362-007182 [silence]
sw04526-A_007182-007453 i've i've uh
sw04526-A_007453-008052 h[eard]- heard the that proposed before and i'm not uh discounting it completely but
sw04526-A_008052-008680 the counter argument to that is that uh there are schools around that are uh
sw04526-A_008680-008784 [silence]
sw04526-A_008784-009699 private schools not necessarily uh parochial schools where the teachers are paid no more than they are in the public schools and they and their track records are much better
sw04526-A_009699-009813 [silence]
sw04526-A_009813-009934 uh
sw04526-A_009934-010109 the uh
sw04526-A_010109-010268 i[n]- in fact
sw04526-A_010268-010656 these days there's a lot of [noise] uh there a lot of
sw04526-A_010656-011927 uh Catholic and other parochial schools around that are not staffed by nuns and and i'm not a Catholic so but i was just reading about this and what they were the
sw04526-A_011927-012456 the argument that i've heard is that uh and i subscribe to some of it by the way
sw04526-A_012456-012654 that uh
sw04526-A_012654-013602 our schools are reflecting the same kind of mismanagement that uh lead to the demise of the Soviet Union and that is when you've got an absolute monopoly
sw04526-A_013602-014493 and uh you can't uh you know it's a one party system so to speak then what you're going to have is gross inefficiencies and nobody cares
sw04526-A_014493-015461 and reality uh uh is just not a market base system and i know i've been in the Orient for about three years and
sw04526-A_015461-016096 the public schools are not very good but the all all of the good schools are private schools over there
sw04526-A_016096-016864 and uh it's not that we're spending i i think that we're spending a lot of money uh relatively speaking on schools
sw04526-A_016864-016990 but uh
sw04526-A_016990-017841 as with other things you know it like De[troit]- Detroit or some of the other problems uh with De[troit]- it's not the worker it's the uh it's the management
sw04526-A_017841-018445 and uh management frankly just doesn't have to they don't have to compete these days
sw04526-A_018445-020398 [silence]
sw04526-A_020398-020523 yes
sw04526-A_020523-020962 [silence]
sw04526-A_020962-021074 [laughter-yeah]

sw04526-A_021198-023062 [silence]
sw04526-A_023062-023762 yeah and and well i see that as a as what i consider the biggest problem uh
sw04526-A_023762-023923 as with
sw04526-A_023923-024909 with uh oh there there are other problems and number one it would be nice if if teachers got paid uh uh i i hate to see the
sw04526-A_024909-025374 how shall i say it the garbage the guys that collect garbage and and uh
sw04526-A_025374-025495 uh
sw04526-A_025495-026010 [laughter-yes] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-well] the sanitation engineers that go out there with uh and [vocalized-noise] just lift uh
sw04526-A_026010-026227 [silence]
sw04526-A_026227-026534 i hate to see those guys get paid more than teachers
sw04526-A_026534-026899 and different teachers are uh under a lot more stress
sw04526-A_026899-027287 and don't get any tips at the end of the day at you know at Christmas time
sw04526-A_027287-027900 so uh uh from that st[andpoint]- and frankly the private school systems uh
sw04526-A_027900-028480 uh including colleges and things like that uh do quite well uh because there is a lot of competition
sw04526-A_028480-029258 and if somebody decides that they're going t[o]- if their decisions are out of step with reality uh pretty soon people don't stop going there
sw04526-A_029258-029415 and uh
sw04526-A_029415-029863 or they get a horrible reputation and they get this uh what do they call that uh

sw04526-B_000050-000320 [silence]
sw04526-B_000320-001142 well um i think that uh the majority of the problem with the school system um
sw04526-B_001142-002374 is similar to the majority of the problem in a lot of other areas in it's a question of economics and the school system is not designed to be successful um
sw04526-B_002374-002709 by that uh it's not really profitable
sw04526-B_002709-003850 for good teachers to be in the school systems uh if there are good school teachers good really qualified people as school teachers it's because they're dedicated not because they're rewarded for doing so
sw04526-B_003850-004050 um [noise]
sw04526-B_004050-004633 the sch[ool]- the public school system uh needs to be viewed i think kind of like
sw04526-B_004633-005991 the highways and hospitals and everything else it's part of the infrastructure it's something that has to be and has to be you know h[ighly]- highly maintained in order for the nation itself to be successful and when you um
sw04526-B_005991-007161 when you neglect part of the infrastructure be it the roads or the schools or whatever then everything kind of follows with that it's just a question of how long before you pay the price
sw04526-B_007161-009669 [silence]
sw04526-B_009669-009789 hm

sw04526-B_017920-018435 [silence]
sw04526-B_018435-018989 yeah i'd heard something as a matter of fact uh kind of along those lines with i think it was the New York school system
sw04526-B_018989-020383 where they suddenly instituted a sort of market system where um basically the kids were allowed to take whatever classes they wanted to and go to whatever school they wanted to and it was up to the schools to attract the kids
sw04526-B_020383-021651 um and offer stuff the kids wanted and what turned out happening this was like area of the country with the highest drop out rate and all this kind of stuff [noise] and what ended up happening is people didn't just take fun classes or anything like that uh it ended up that
sw04526-B_021651-022590 uh the rate of of graduating students went way way up and they ended up taking real courses but it was because they wanted to and because_1 they chose to instead of were being forced to and
sw04526-B_022590-023123 and the the people were forced to compete and and the good teachers were getting the students and that kind of stuff

sw04540-A_002240-003714 so you know i- i guess i really am not uh in favor of a lot of restrictions on on handguns just because_1 lea[st]- at least the environment i grew up in uh we're all taught in an early age to to respect them_1 and handle them_1 properly
sw04540-A_003714-004467 um unfortunately most i guess most people aren't um and so that presents kind of a a a problem
sw04540-A_004467-004894 um funny you know some restrictions may be necessary but uh
sw04540-A_004894-005227 you know a total ban or something like that i think is kind of
sw04540-A_005227-005320 yeah

sw04540-A_010410-011014 in actually you know i have never hunted uh which is the ironic thing uh i've done a lot of target shooting

sw04540-B_004530-005134 [silence]
sw04540-B_005134-005298 out of the question yeah
sw04540-B_005298-005531 yeah i uh i went through the same thing i
sw04540-B_005531-006317 i uh you know we do a lot of hunting out here and stuff and you know rifles and stuff we've never had a problem with handguns sometimes i wonder because_1
sw04540-B_006317-006845 you know what do you do with a handgun i mean you don't you really you can't hunt with it uh
sw04540-B_006845-008033 i mean you know you you can know how to treat them_1 or you know how to to use them_1 properly but i just have a har[d]- you know i don't think there ought to be a outright ban but i think there ought to be some more restrictions on handguns rather than rifles
sw04540-B_008033-009034 just because it's so much easier to conceal a handgun f[or]- it's easy for a kid to get to it and and you know hurt himself with a handgun i think more so than even a rifle
sw04540-B_009034-010143 so i yeah i'm along with you there i just i have real hard time with handguns but uh like i say i don't want anybody taking my rifles away from me [laughter] but uh
sw04540-B_010143-010587 yeah uh d[id]- did you hunt much out there or in Kansas or
sw04540-B_010587-010762 uh-huh
sw04540-B_010762-010947 yeah
sw04540-B_010947-011089 um-hum
sw04540-B_011089-011278 [silence]
sw04540-B_011278-011416 yeah
sw04540-B_011416-012157 well that that you know really gets into that rights thing i mean there's there's a fine line i guess in everything and gun control is one where
sw04540-B_012157-012532 you know if you could get some proper training and education it's
sw04540-B_012532-012661 [silence]
sw04540-B_012661-013451 you know i think you'd you'd find that all th[e]- the accidents would definitely go down and i you know i remember taking hunter safety and i was like eleven or twelve years old
sw04540-B_013451-013874 i mean before my dad would take me out deer hunting at all even you know even though i wasn't hunting
sw04540-B_013874-014109 i had to know how to handle a gun and
sw04540-B_014109-014648 i- i think you're right though i- you know a lot of the inner cities and stuff like that they just don't get that kind of training
sw04540-B_014648-014829 and uh
sw04540-B_014829-015917 and i you know i'm a i the only that i hate is uh well along with that training is i when kids have accidents with guns i there's a lot of stuff coming out now that they're going to start holding the parents responsible for not
sw04540-B_015917-017246 making the gun safe and i think there's a lot to that because kids are just naturally curious and then and you know when they're five and six years old accidents will happen that's why you know they need to be locked up the ammunition kept separate and all kinds of stuff
sw04540-B_017246-017448 [silence]
sw04540-B_017448-017614 yeah yeah
sw04540-B_017614-018057 [silence]
sw04540-B_018057-018564 well i mean i don't i have a real hard time with even keeping a a loaded weapon in my house uh
sw04540-B_018564-019619 you know you hear you hear somebody come in your house and you're a lot better off letting them take about whatever they want if they're there to steal something rather than take a chance be the hero and get shot or something i
sw04540-B_019619-020078 you know i just there's nothing more valuable than life [laughter-itself] so
sw04540-B_020078-020172 but
sw04540-B_020172-020583 yeah i- i definitely i you know was reading the article on uh
sw04540-B_020583-021462 well on this Ross Perot you know how he's talking about running for the Presidency and i guess he's a conservative uh you know he's more of a Republican politically but
sw04540-B_021462-022304 he's got he had some wild ideas about gun control i guess he's really fo[r]- he's he's for gun control big time and he was saying how he would go in for some
sw04540-B_022304-023134 some unwarranted searches and seizures of any guns that aren't registered and that really surprised me i like i say i wouldn't want that to to happen
sw04540-B_023134-024061 [silence]
sw04540-B_024061-024159 um-hum
sw04540-B_024159-024307 [silence]
sw04540-B_024307-024483 yeah yeah
sw04540-B_024483-025027 i yeah i understand he was pro he was he was for uh abortion rights
sw04540-B_025027-026060 uh and i was really like i say it really surprised me because most of those guys i mean from that the conservative end they are just i mean gun control one hundred percent the NRA is their best friend and
sw04540-B_026060-026788 the best lobbyist so i was kind of surprised to see that but you know i think though on the outside too the NRA sometimes goes overboard you know
sw04540-B_026788-026932 [silence]
sw04540-B_026932-027775 [noise] you know they're i think they're like any lobbyist you've got extremists on both ends you know and they're saying that there's nothing wrong with these assault rifles and this that and the other you know
sw04540-B_027775-028388 and and handguns are just fine and i just think you know there's some middle ground there to where
sw04540-B_028388-029675 that they maybe go overboard and do too much they i guess they do have a lot of lobbying pow[er]- power and you know their big thing is well if you you stop banning one type then it's going to lead to the next and so on and
sw04540-B_029675-029904 yeah and i you know i
sw04548-A_000000-000137 [noise] well actually uh
sw04548-A_000137-000362 i i don't think i'm in the uh
sw04548-A_000362-001606 uh majority of in in Texas i don't think i agree with no uh i wouldn't say that i think i would have said that a few years ago when i was younger i thought it was a
sw04548-A_001606-002147 a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have uh capital punishment but
sw04548-A_002147-002649 um uh maybe slowly changing my opinion
sw04548-A_002649-002784 i'm not
sw04548-A_002784-003031 thoroughly opposed to it i still think it's
sw04548-A_003031-003211 sort of true that a
sw04548-A_003211-003898 a more civilized society wouldn't have to use capital punishment but i'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than i thought [laughter]

sw04548-A_009532-009618 yeah
sw04548-A_009618-010027 i certainly don't uh advocate turning people like that loose
sw04548-A_010027-010389 i'm not sure executing them uh
sw04548-A_010389-010798 does anymore than keeping them in jail but uh
sw04548-A_010798-010925 [noise]
sw04548-A_010925-011155 yeah that's a factor
sw04548-A_011155-013364 [silence]

sw04548-A_013462-013768 [silence]

sw04548-A_014469-014576 yeah
sw04548-A_014576-015077 well i the cost is something but it's i think it's relatively unimportant compared to
sw04548-A_015077-015281 what's the most effective way of
sw04548-A_015281-015629 dealing with crime and i guess uh
sw04548-A_015629-016575 i would like i don't know the European countries certainly uh none of them have capital punishment and they don't have a they don't have a crime problem either no you can't they don't execute anybody in Britain
sw04548-A_016575-017486 or France and i don't believe they do in Germany or Italy either [noise] and they don't have the crime problems we do i don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two
sw04548-A_017486-017833 i guess what worries me about capital punishment is uh
sw04548-A_017833-018185 when i see people enthusiastic about it and uh
sw04548-A_018185-018277 uh
sw04548-A_018277-019032 sort of bloodthirsty i think it brings out the worst in the in the people who do the punishing and the that that bothers me but it but uh

sw04548-A_020513-021111 [silence]
sw04548-A_021111-021746 well actually i wha[t]- the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because i don't really think it uh
sw04548-A_021746-022049 i don't really think it's a s[ubject]- um
sw04548-A_022049-023171 very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else i think it just becomes a uh [noise] symbolic i'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians so
sw04548-A_023171-024428 i would like for it to be settled once for all and uh get in the background while the more important issues get discussed uh uh like i said some years ago i think i would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the
sw04548-A_024428-025447 civilized western country now i'm i'm not so sure of that i'm i i wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and nor nor the other way around [noise]
sw04548-A_025447-025734 [silence]
sw04548-A_025734-026095 uh i guess i'm i'm my view of
sw04548-A_026095-026254 [noise] uh
sw04548-A_026254-026753 my i'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and uh
sw04548-A_026753-026918 that uh
sw04548-A_026918-027059 uh
sw04548-A_027059-028327 costs and other factors justify uh um executing people maybe it's more a symbolic gesture that um um than anything else and uh
sw04548-A_028327-028672 i've also never been a victim although i have some
sw04548-A_028672-029020 i have two friends whose wives were murdered and uh
sw04548-A_029020-029230 i can imagine that uh
sw04548-A_029230-029699 uh for some people it would be the only form of justice in that case

sw04548-B_002597-002761 yeah
sw04548-B_002761-003777 [silence]
sw04548-B_003777-004435 [laughter] you sound a lot like a friend of mine a a girl i hang out with she has very
sw04548-B_004435-005464 very black and white opinions you know there's no gray in her opinions you know she she probably would agree more with you but but i don't know i think
sw04548-B_005464-005983 i would rather a person go ahead and be put down than give them the [noise] opportunity to
sw04548-B_005983-007398 get out and do it again i've never had a a punishment or a a crime like a murder touch my immediate family but i still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to to
sw04548-B_007398-008661 punish especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done and we see that more and more like in our state right now there's a fourteen year old boy who
sw04548-B_008661-009706 raped and then killed a seven year old girl you know that's fourteen years old what's he going to be doing when he turns into an adult

sw04548-B_010709-011050 no it doesn't but it costs less
sw04548-B_011050-012019 and yeah to me it is i mean i work and i pay my taxes and i lived out in Texas for a little while and they're
sw04548-B_012019-013054 it that's a pretty heavy state compared to Georgia i mean you guys are are a lot more uh for to each his own even than we are in Georgia but even in Georgia
sw04548-B_013054-013839 that's the attitude for the most part if i work and pay my dues you work and pay your dues and we'd get along just fine
sw04548-B_013839-014337 but when i've got to work to pay my dues and your [laughter-dues]
sw04548-B_014337-014557 then i don't like you very much anymore

sw04548-B_020208-021302 guts to do it because i couldn't i couldn't stand behind a gun and shoot somebody for nothing and i couldn't pull the switch but i

sw04555-B_014438-015558 who work in the recreation field for companies like this and actually um a break like that increases productivity and and with the commensurate um
sw04555-B_015558-016744 increase in physical fitness by the people who attend these centers regularly you have uh fewer absentees and things like that so the corporation can justify it pretty well
sw04555-B_016744-017523 and it's not like i'm taking time away from the company i probably put in extra hours because i'm now physically fit and
sw04555-B_017523-018186 reenergized i mean that [vocalized-noise] my routine around two two thirty to go down there for an hour
sw04555-B_018186-018999 [noise] probably makes the last three hours of the day then more productive than i would if i [noise] you know just sort of went on through so

sw04565-A_010043-010175 um
sw04565-A_010175-010555 [silence]
sw04565-A_010555-011311 well i'll tell you television sure makes child rearing easy on you i mean the kids can be a real pest uh
sw04565-A_011311-011814 and turning the TV on is almost like magic you know it's uh like
sw04565-A_011814-012365 sticking uh an electrode into their pleasure center and you don't have to worry about them_1
sw04565-A_012365-012800 but i don't think it's too good
sw04565-A_012800-012930 [silence]
sw04565-A_012930-013687 um so you know i don't know i take advantage i don't have a great deal of time to spend with the kids but i take advantage of
sw04565-A_013687-014037 um dinner time we always eat together and
sw04565-A_014037-014545 you know whenever you're with your kids you wanna interact with them rather than just ignore them
sw04565-A_014545-014953 [silence]
sw04565-A_014953-015890 uh i guess our big outlet is music um our thirteen year old son plays violin and our nine year old daughter plays cello
sw04565-A_015890-016742 and uh when our son started playing violin i took up violin and when our daughter started playing cello i took up cello so there's plenty of
sw04565-A_016742-017400 plenty of interactive time in uh practicing although neither kid likes to practice
sw04565-A_017400-017676 i guess that's not a big surprise
sw04565-A_017676-017783 [silence]
sw04565-A_017783-018224 but i mea[n]- i imagine with infants you [noise] are
sw04565-A_018224-018716 [noise] most of your time is sort of spent taking care of them rather than interacting with them
sw04565-A_018716-018867 [silence]
sw04565-A_018867-018979 although y[ou]-
sw04565-A_018979-019463 [silence]

sw04565-A_019740-020884 i uh i took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little and i still try to read to them although our son is not liking that anymore
sw04565-A_020884-021421 uh but i read you know there's this Doctor Seuss sleep book have you ever seen that yet

sw04565-B_024308-025162 i like to do it and they enjoy reading and i've actually i never read a lot growing up
sw04565-B_025162-025685 and i never read until a few years ago i just started picking up books and
sw04565-B_025685-026592 so it i've found that you know it's really important to me to get to read to i like to get away in a book you know
sw04565-B_026592-027142 and so i've put a lot more emphasis on that on my kids
sw04565-B_027142-027339 to try
sw04565-B_027339-027573 [silence]
sw04565-B_027573-027937 oh i probably spend an hour or two
sw04565-B_027937-028862 my wife works at night so she does uh Tupperware so she's gone a lot at nights and so i spend a lot of time with them_1
sw04565-B_028862-029013 [silence]
sw04565-B_029013-029231 they're two and one
sw04565-B_029231-029379 um-hum

sw04565-B_029565-029795 yeah
sw04570-A_000000-000004 [silence]
sw04570-A_000004-000284 uh do you have a couple of children
sw04570-A_000284-000463 uh-huh
sw04570-A_000463-000625 oh boy [laughter]
sw04570-A_000625-000819 at least you're sleeping
sw04570-A_000819-001025 [silence]
sw04570-A_001025-001556 i have uh two boys one's eleven and one's fourteen
sw04570-A_001556-002170 i imagine the activities we uh encounter with our kids are quite [laughter-different] [laughter-at] [laughter-this] point
sw04570-A_002170-002678 [silence]
sw04570-A_002678-003536 oh i remember them fondly it seems like th[e]- the b[aby]- like young children uh destroy your sleep and older children destroy your [laughter-life]
sw04570-A_003536-003802 and i don't really mean that it
sw04570-A_003802-004376 [silence]
sw04570-A_004376-004523 oh
sw04570-A_004523-004839 [silence]
sw04570-A_004839-005221 i think the biggest problem is that you just have no training for this
sw04570-A_005221-005534 and you really have to wing it you know as you go
sw04570-A_005534-006657 but i i remember fondly having the small ones they they seemed real happy and it was so easy to solve their problems and as they get older it just seems that everything is more serious a[nd]- a[nd]-
sw04570-A_006657-007409 it's more complicated it's emotional it's not a matter of giving them_1 a lollipop anymore i[t]- it just gets harder
sw04570-A_007409-008384 but um what we've done and you might want to do as you know as time flies by is i'm remarried and my husband never had any kids
sw04570-A_008384-009372 so we were trying to figure out how um how we would make this turnover as smooth as possible and we came up with what we call the family meeting
sw04570-A_009372-010061 and once a week we get together and this is a chance when the kids can say whatever they want without us getting insulted about it
sw04570-A_010061-011002 and we have sort of an agenda that's like good news this week bad news this week uh suggestions any new business any uh
sw04570-A_011002-011446 any que[stions]- questions any anything [laughter-you] [laughter-know] and we
sw04570-A_011446-011548 [silence]
sw04570-A_011548-012657 well i[t]- it changes it could be a quiet week it could be the kind of thing where kids want to go do something [laughter-else] so it goes pretty quick at the end is allowance so they have to make it through [laughter-you] [laughter-know] collect
sw04570-A_012657-012896 [silence]
sw04570-A_012896-013553 well you know we we actually sit and talk to each other once a week at least [laughter-you] [laughter-know] not that we don't all the time
sw04570-A_013553-014198 but it i[t]- it works out nicely and i don't know you know i think i'd do that even if i wasn't remarried if i had thought about it
sw04570-A_014198-015116 and you know we p[lan]- also plan a family activity because people are coming and going and it's hard to be all together to do something so
sw04570-A_015116-016183 well it could be a game of Scrabble an[d]- or it could be you know reading a book out loud or making up a story and passing it around the table you know one sentence to each person
sw04570-A_016183-017273 and um it's it's not something that's impossible i mean the kids will usually want to go to a game park or something you know we can't do that you [laughter-know] we try to keep it real
sw04570-A_017273-017431 [silence]
sw04570-A_017431-017632 oh [laughter-please]
sw04570-A_017632-018049 yeah that another thing that comes up with us is family vacation
sw04570-A_018049-018601 we just kind of knock our heads we don't know how to make that right it seems as if we do what they want
sw04570-A_018601-019578 uh we {marathoned} a trip in California we stayed with some relatives for awhile and then we went to Sea World and we went to Disneyland and we we went to every kid thing
sw04570-A_019578-020213 uh no we we flew to California and we stayed free at my aunt's house so that gave us a base in San Diego
sw04570-A_020213-021054 and we saw Sea World and the zoo and this and that and our lives were sort of normal because w[e]- you know it was someone else's house so we made sure we had dinner at dinnertime and that kind of thing
sw04570-A_021054-021863 then we drove a bit further and when we were on our own it just kind of fell apart because_1 we'd stay late at the parks and
sw04570-A_021863-022609 i didn't enjoy it after awhile you know once is you know it's interesting but it's really not my cup of tea and family vacations are kind of difficult
sw04570-A_022609-023124 you know sharing a room with the kids is not much [laughter-of] [laughter-a] [laughter-vacation] once they're old enough to know the difference
sw04570-A_023124-023273 so
sw04570-A_023273-025281 [silence]
sw04570-A_025281-025534 hm
sw04570-A_025534-026317 [silence]
sw04570-A_026317-026739 well i guess the playgrounds used to be hot when the kids [laughter-were] [laughter-little]

sw04570-A_026987-027115 huh
sw04570-A_027115-027521 [silence]
sw04570-A_027521-027780 there might be some at the schools
sw04570-A_027780-028203 you know that you can use when it's an off time you know on a weekend or something
sw04570-A_028203-029183 and a lot of if you have a a YMCA or something they have kind of a tot programs where they have little exercise class for kids her age and all kinds of things

sw04570-B_017209-017521 it's getting quite expensive to do that these days
sw04570-B_017521-017767 [laughter]
sw04570-B_017767-017995 [silence]
sw04570-B_017995-018205 yeah

sw04570-B_022713-023221 [laughter] true true
sw04570-B_023221-024263 yeah my husband wants to go on a family vacation we're on the east coast like you and he wants to go out to uh the Grand Canyon and do that sort of thing when Helen gets a little older but
sw04570-B_024263-025350 it's hard to tell i at twenty months old he's he wants take her to the zoo and that sort of thing but i'm not sure if she's ready for any of that if she's you know if it could hold her interest
sw04570-B_025350-026019 so we don't really have anything any kind of family activities to do we basically just sit around the house and
sw04570-B_026019-026472 she runs from one to the other and we read to her that's something she enjoys
sw04570-B_026472-026654 [silence]
sw04570-B_026654-027063 yeah there's not many of them_1 out there though like was when i was young

sw04570-B_029102-029213 hm
sw04570-B_029213-029382 probably
sw04570-B_029382-029952 probably be very hard to be the instructor [laughter] twenty months old [laughter]
sw04572-A_000000-000014 [noise]
sw04572-A_000014-000449 so uh what things do you consider an invasion of privacy
sw04572-A_000449-001179 [silence]
sw04572-A_001179-001561 oh i don't i don't know i had a little bit more time to think about it i was thinking of like uh
sw04572-A_001561-001725 [noise]
sw04572-A_001725-002015 i don't know i st[arted]- i started to think about all the big
sw04572-A_002015-002631 you know data bases they have with all the information about you on them_1 like the credit reports and
sw04572-A_002631-002978 and all those you know demographics studies that they do that
sw04572-A_002978-003178 um you know have
sw04572-A_003178-003438 who knows how much you know
sw04572-A_003438-003736 stuff about all the purchases that you've made and
sw04572-A_003736-003999 everything kept tract somewhere and
sw04572-A_003999-004070 [noise]
sw04572-A_004070-004508 i don't know i don't know how much the stuff actually what they actually have in there but
sw04572-A_004508-004781 i know they use that i mean they
sw04572-A_004781-004936 they sell those t[o]-
sw04572-A_004936-005607 [silence]
sw04572-A_005607-005937 yeah that was that w[as]- that was the other one i was thinking of
sw04572-A_005937-006001 [noise]
sw04572-A_006001-006139 i think that's uh
sw04572-A_006139-006314 [silence]
sw04572-A_006314-006506 i mean i know drugs are illegal
sw04572-A_006506-007130 [silence]
sw04572-A_007130-007332 uh uh-huh
sw04572-A_007332-008044 [silence]
sw04572-A_008044-008170 um-hum
sw04572-A_008170-009744 [silence]
sw04572-A_009744-009871 uh-huh
sw04572-A_009871-012533 [silence]

sw04572-A_012661-014413 [silence]
sw04572-A_014413-014742 um-hum [noise] well i i think that um
sw04572-A_014742-014856 [silence]
sw04572-A_014856-015387 i think that you know a person's competence should be more determined by
sw04572-A_015387-015690 you know their actions and their behavior and if they're
sw04572-A_015690-015869 you know if they're on some kind of
sw04572-A_015869-016719 you know controll[ed]- controlled substance then you know it kinds of takes away from the job of you know the supervisor or manager type person
sw04572-A_016719-017317 know who is able to evaluate them i think they should be evaluated that way rather than [noise] with a
sw04572-A_017317-017556 you know a chemical you know
sw04572-A_017556-018849 [silence]
sw04572-A_018849-019284 the people that are carriers and don't uh don't reveal it
sw04572-A_019284-020146 [silence]
sw04572-A_020146-020508 [laughter-yeah] that's that would be kind of an extreme
sw04572-A_020508-020873 i mean i've heard of things like you know making them_1
sw04572-A_020873-021397 you know uh marking them somehow or you know or something like that or
sw04572-A_021397-021846 you know putting them_1 all s[ome]- some place like in a kind of a
sw04572-A_021846-022133 [silence]
sw04572-A_022133-022434 yeah well i guess it kind of borders on where
sw04572-A_022434-022578 i mean
sw04572-A_022578-023226 what do you value more the invasion of uh the person's privacy or the possible danger to
sw04572-A_023226-023448 you know other people
sw04572-A_023448-024222 [silence]
sw04572-A_024222-024354 yeah
sw04572-A_024354-024508 [silence]
sw04572-A_024508-024889 i guess that's alway[s]- that's been the big role of government i guess
sw04572-A_024889-025067 i mean [vocalized-noise] generally
sw04572-A_025067-025225 [laughter-yeah]
sw04572-A_025225-025342 yeah
sw04572-A_025342-025462 well
sw04572-A_025462-025969 yeah that's kind of a difficult one to go into i mean that that particular case
sw04572-A_025969-026501 because i mean there's a lot of people that uh i mean they could require o[ne]- you know
sw04572-A_026501-027683 o[bligatory]- obligatory AIDS testing for everyone because i'm s[ure]- you know there's a huge part of the population not a huge part but a you know the the AIDS population i guess that have it that don't know they do
sw04572-A_027683-027876 an[d]- are spreading it
sw04572-A_027876-029032 but again to require you know such a test and jus[t]- and then to make make it known they have it is to subject them to to discrimi[natory]- discriminatory practices
sw04572-A_029032-029220 and other things
sw04572-A_029220-029651 i don't know uh i don't know how exactly i feel about that

sw04572-B_004608-004796 [silence]
sw04572-B_004796-005567 well what about the required drug testing uh as a uh condition of employment
sw04572-B_005567-006352 [silence]
sw04572-B_006352-006706 it [noise] a subtle thing actually um
sw04572-B_006706-006774 [noise]
sw04572-B_006774-007148 i uh have worked at Texas Instruments
sw04572-B_007148-007258 [silence]
sw04572-B_007258-008106 and uh they instituted a drug policy there drug testing policy where they randomly would test uh employees
sw04572-B_008106-008227 [silence]
sw04572-B_008227-009155 and actually to tell you the truth i really didn't think much about it i i hadn't you know it really didn't relate to me but there were some things that people
sw04572-B_009155-009808 brought up like well what happens if they they get a false positive you know what recourse do you have
sw04572-B_009808-009956 and
sw04572-B_009956-010098 [noise]
sw04572-B_010098-010338 also um
sw04572-B_010338-010501 [silence]
sw04572-B_010501-011511 uh this is against the law for the government to do this kind of thing this kind of big brother activity and yet uh
sw04572-B_011511-012100 a lot of these large corporations such as Texas Instruments although they don't admit to it it's actually
sw04572-B_012100-012542 oh a drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure
sw04572-B_012542-012645 [silence]
sw04572-B_012645-012765 so
sw04572-B_012765-012859 [noise]
sw04572-B_012859-014042 what that means is to me that really it's the government that's requiring this although they don't actually e[xecute]- execute it themselves it's really the government's that so in that sense a[t]- at least uh
sw04572-B_014042-014462 philosophically it's really borderline legal
sw04572-B_014462-017345 [silence]
sw04572-B_017345-018017 [noise] well what about this uh AIDS epidemic now where you find that uh
sw04572-B_018017-018078 [noise]
sw04572-B_018078-018887 uh you know certain people are actually are are criminal in their disregard for
sw04572-B_018887-019000 [vocalized-noise]
sw04572-B_019000-019246 others yeah and
sw04572-B_019246-019897 and uh of course the ultimate solution is to operate on their brain so that it doesn't get uh
sw04572-B_019897-020186 it destroys their libido
sw04572-B_020186-020401 [silence]
sw04572-B_020401-020700 now uh you know if they ever
sw04572-B_020700-021746 [silence]
sw04572-B_021746-022052 so what about that as an invasion of privacy
sw04572-B_022052-022153 [silence]
sw04572-B_022153-022274 yeah
sw04572-B_022274-023437 [silence]
sw04572-B_023437-024017 so really it i[t]- gets to balancing uh personal freedom against
sw04572-B_024017-024272 uh the general welfare
sw04572-B_024272-024441 of society

sw04572-B_025967-026115 [noise] now it
sw04572-B_026115-027241 [silence]

sw04576-A_000000-000192 [noise] -[o]kay i um
sw04576-A_000192-001212 to let you know what i feel about drug testing uh i have my qualms about having the government or anyone else for that matter
sw04576-A_001212-002127 testing randomly everybody across the board for various drugs however i am not against
sw04576-A_002127-003401 testing those people who are in critical uh jobs for example airline pilots subway drivers you know people who are responsible for other people's safety
sw04576-A_003401-003607 [silence]
sw04576-A_003607-003715 [noise]
sw04576-A_003715-003976 correct i just think that it's
sw04576-A_003976-005145 uh unnecessary and really the medical testing facilities that are available now have been shown to have problems in the past as far as reliability is concerned
sw04576-A_005145-005714 and uh we have had situations here where people were accused of um
sw04576-A_005714-006536 uh utilizing drugs and uh it turned out they were on some other medication which was giving false positives
sw04576-A_006536-006907 [silence]
sw04576-A_006907-007010 um-hum

sw04576-A_007872-007964 [noise]
sw04576-A_007964-008333 uh do you more or less follow on the same lines as i do or

sw04576-A_010614-010720 [noise]
sw04576-A_010720-011353 [silence]
sw04576-A_011353-011828 yeah i- i know that they were up here in New York um
sw04576-A_011828-012613 uh i've noticed what they have been trying to do the governor here isn't thrilled with the idea and we have uh
sw04576-A_012613-013842 various government officials here who basically don't feel that is a good idea for along the same lines but they're continuously clashing with the federal government which because of it's {antidrug} war
sw04576-A_013842-015093 um figures well since we're not really accomplishing much of [laughter-anything] [laughter-internationally] let's make big headlines by going out and being for mandatory drug testing and
sw04576-A_015093-015941 [noise] yeah and and that way we'll we'll nail those nine to five worker users without really solving the problem
sw04576-A_015941-016447 of trying to really do something and through education and that
sw04576-A_016447-017067 yeah they the federal government seems to be a lot more aggressive about this um
sw04576-A_017067-017965 than uh anything else it's interesting that you find out with all these little scandals going on now such as in the house with the post office cocaine scandal
sw04576-A_017965-018165 you know all that um
sw04576-A_018165-018409 [silence]

sw04576-A_021373-021524 yeah
sw04576-A_021524-022603 [noise] yeah it's one of these slippery slope issues where once you start by allowing this kind of randomized drug testing it's the same thing with the lie detectors
sw04576-A_022603-023706 and uh the physiological tes[t]- [noise] tests that go on um really i think you know we are seeing more and more of privacy taken away
sw04576-A_023706-024810 um courtesy of the federal government as time goes on because of the almighty rights of the employer to know every possible thing about their employees
sw04576-A_024810-025796 and uh at times it's hypocritical as well because those in positions of leadership that want these things certainly don't want them applied to themselves [laughter]

sw04576-A_025881-026195 [silence]
sw04576-A_026195-027206 yeah i- i- i don't know how much you've had experience as far as in the newspapers coming across people who have gotten into trouble with the drug stuff here in in Ro[chester]- Rochester
sw04576-A_027206-027784 in western New York there hasn't been a terrible lot but we of course hear about the subway drivers in New York City
sw04576-A_027784-028690 who slammed into someone and of course you know the airline pilots are rumored you know there are already rumors of rampant alcoholism now cocaine usage

sw04588-A_007368-007577 [silence]
sw04588-A_007577-008762 it doesn't seem seem like it's useful for him to uh doesn't it seem like a waste of money though for him to come back into the race this late uh what are his chances of winning at this point
sw04588-A_008762-009236 [silence]
sw04588-A_009236-009379 exactly

sw04588-A_011515-012567 [silence]
sw04588-A_012567-012778 uh-huh uh-huh
sw04588-A_012778-013560 [silence]

sw04588-A_014956-015325 [silence]
sw04588-A_015325-016373 right right well it's yeah i i agree with you it does seem that he came in and kind of fluffed the pillows uh you know uh for the c[ampaign]- for the campaign anyway so we didn't have to hear the same thing again
sw04588-A_016373-017318 uh we didn't have to uh [noise] we didn't have to ignore a lot of uh Bush's success because you know he really did a lot in the last term he uh
sw04588-A_017318-018348 wi[th]- with the Gulf War and all we could have we could have had our judgement clouded just by his his accomplishments you know i i really do think i am going to vote for him again next term but
sw04588-A_018348-018907 but uh i wanted to know exactly everything that happened you know a lot of times maybe i forget
sw04588-A_018907-019765 [silence]
sw04588-A_019765-019916 oh sure
sw04588-A_019916-020153 [silence]
sw04588-A_020153-020286 uh-huh
sw04588-A_020286-020771 [silence]
sw04588-A_020771-020897 uh-huh
sw04588-A_020897-021236 [silence]
sw04588-A_021236-021355 right
sw04588-A_021355-022840 right uh wha[t]- what i mean is so that the strong sense of uh nationalism that occurred you know right after the war uh sort of heroized George Bush you know whether or not it was you know a success for us or whatnot [noise] he tended to come out of the out of the
sw04588-A_022840-023319 experience you know as the great American hero and uh
sw04588-A_023319-023547 [silence]
sw04588-A_023547-023767 yeah yeah
sw04588-A_023767-024810 so i i i am i'm glad that uh he can't get into office this time without at least uh addressing a lot of the a lot of the home front issues
sw04588-A_024810-025256 and uh well Todd uh it sounds like uh
sw04588-A_025256-025940 we may have covered a uh a minuscule portion of politics today [laughter]
sw04588-A_025940-026371 what about Libya i have no idea what to say about
sw04588-A_026371-026732 yeah i i don't know uh
sw04588-A_026732-026810 [noise]
sw04588-A_026810-027752 if you know if you'd asked me the same question about uh uh Kuwait you know at this early in the game i don't what i would have said then either i i don't
sw04588-A_027752-027850 [noise]
sw04588-A_027850-028262 uh now of course the last time i listened to anything was on Sunday
sw04588-A_028262-028940 uh and they had still refused uh the concessions by the Security Council so
sw04588-A_028940-029807 [silence]
sw04588-A_029807-029978 right
sw04588-B_000000-000102 [noise]
sw04588-B_000102-000264 [silence]
sw04588-B_000264-001166 well uh interestingly enough i've been reading in the paper about uh the option that says basically none of the above
sw04588-B_001166-002471 a[nd]- and uh given the choices that's sometimes how i feel i generally support President Bush and i feel like he gets a lot of bad press you know the the economy is really not his fault i don't think
sw04588-B_002471-002951 but uh as far as anybody else running i think
sw04588-B_002951-003618 wow [laughter] is this the best we have to offer two hundred fifty million people to choose from and this is what we get
sw04588-B_003618-004872 [silence]
sw04588-B_004872-005599 yeah what i heard this morning is that although he has dropped out he's still got a lot of support in New York apparently
sw04588-B_005599-006855 and t[oday]- t[oday]- you know it today is uh the New York primary and they seem to be saying that if he got a good he's still on the ballot in New York and they said if he got a good showing in New York then he would jump back in
sw04588-B_006855-008725 [silence]
sw04588-B_008725-009321 [noise] well [laughter] obviously he thought they weren't too good if he if he backed out
sw04588-B_009321-009484 uh
sw04588-B_009484-009876 i don't know maybe you know New York is a big primary
sw04588-B_009876-010676 and there are a lot of others still to come maybe he feels like if he can carry New York strongly then he could still make it
sw04588-B_010676-010824 [silence]
sw04588-B_010824-011112 but uh i don't know
sw04588-B_011112-011621 [silence]
sw04588-B_011621-011810 uh
sw04588-B_011810-011980 [silence]
sw04588-B_011980-012711 it's hard to say it's nice to get somebody in there i would certainly never vote for him as far as i know
sw04588-B_012711-013632 but it it's nice to have somebody else bring some issues to the front and at least ask the President some questions and have him have to defend himself
sw04588-B_013632-014479 so i think in that sense it's good i don't think that uh he's experienced enough to do the job uh
sw04588-B_014479-015438 on the other hand maybe he is i mean [laughter] the newspaper men tell us all the politics anyway so maybe he can just go ahead and keep doing it
sw04588-B_015438-015622 how about you
sw04588-B_015622-016314 [silence]
sw04588-B_016314-016439 yeah
sw04588-B_016439-017927 [silence]
sw04588-B_017927-018078 um-hum
sw04588-B_018078-018887 [silence]
sw04588-B_018887-019839 [noise] well when you look at it too how much does the Gulf War really count i mean how for example how much has it helped us as as a people
sw04588-B_019839-020901 i'm sure that we can say it helped the uh enemy rate of Kuwait um and uh sure it shook a peo[ple]- a few people up in Iraq but
sw04588-B_020901-021444 i[s]- is that a success or is that just sort of uh part of the job description as far as the President goes
sw04588-B_021444-021915 [silence]
sw04588-B_021915-022051 yeah
sw04588-B_022051-023144 [silence]
sw04588-B_023144-023684 oh yeah yeah his his popularity was somewhere close to ninety percent at the time
sw04588-B_023684-023805 and it
sw04588-B_023805-024477 [silence]
sw04588-B_024477-024640 yeah
sw04588-B_024640-024811 uh-huh
sw04588-B_024811-025664 [silence]
sw04588-B_025664-026017 a very minuscule portion so what about Libya
sw04588-B_026017-026214 yeah
sw04588-B_026214-026513 you you've heard of the goings on there i guess
sw04588-B_026513-029099 [silence]
sw04588-B_029099-029978 i thought it was le[t]- i have to make sure i get the uh stories right because because there was also yesterday the attrac[t]- the attacks on the Embassy but now didn't Libya
sw04590-A_000000-000484 [noise] uh do you have any brilliant [inedeas/ideas] about [laughter-how] [laughter-to] reduce crime
sw04590-A_000484-002012 [silence]
sw04590-A_002012-002180 it seems
sw04590-A_002180-003583 well it it seems like such a catch twenty two you know my first inclination is to say stop being so lenient when people do something rotten you keep them_1 in jail and you make them know that your se[rious]- you're very serious [noise] uh but then again uh
sw04590-A_003583-005076 the taxing situation you know how can we pay to keep all these people in jail that's when you say well don't raise my taxes you know maybe we shouldn't lock up the guy who has too many traffic tickets yeah maybe we shouldn't do this an[d]- you know and then you stop start eroding it
sw04590-A_005076-005484 you know i substitute teach i deal with high school kids and
sw04590-A_005484-006143 an[d]- i- i find that attitudes at home are such i mean the kids will curse right in front of my face and
sw04590-A_006143-006921 they won't even go oops you know they they just have no regard and i'm not saying they're gonna turn into criminals but i think it's a general trend toward
sw04590-A_006921-007988 people just relaxing their standards so much and i think that's why we have more crime because parents and schools are not stopping this when the kids are young
sw04590-A_007988-008222 and they just keep pushing
sw04590-A_008222-009208 [silence]
sw04590-A_009208-009361 yeah well you know
sw04590-A_009361-009983 yeah generally you know a kid'll do something that's outrageous and they'll say well what are you going to do to me and it's almost like the criminal system
sw04590-A_009983-010733 there's not much i can do to them i can't really do anything to them one fellow said i said how about_1 you do your work and he said well how about_1 i throw these scissors at you
sw04590-A_010733-011950 and instead of getting uh flustered i said well i wish you would because_1 then i can really punish you i can send you to detention et cetera if you just bad mouth me and generally giving me a hard time there's really nothing i can do
sw04590-A_011950-012502 an[d]- and i think you know minor criminals feel the same way like what are they [laughter-gonna] do
sw04590-A_012502-013542 and and i think that's the the biggest thing that unless people know that you're serious and you're not gonna tolerate that kind of behavior in anybody i this is just gonna keep going
sw04590-A_013542-014956 [silence]
sw04590-A_014956-016189 well we had a yeah we had a big incident at the local high school a teacher who happened to be a parent and four girls were um in a horrible head on accident a drunk driver hit them
sw04590-A_016189-017250 um the people who were in the car who got hit two of them died and two of them seriously injured this guy you know crossed a divider he had been arrested twice for drunk dri[ving]- driving
sw04590-A_017250-017802 um they didn't lock him up they took his license away but they didn't take away his car key
sw04590-A_017802-018798 you know there he was you know [laughter-it's] [laughter-like] you know in the old Arab countries you know you steal they take your hand away i mean this guy can still drive as long as he can get into a car he's driving
sw04590-A_018798-018950 you know he's just
sw04590-A_018950-019136 [silence]
sw04590-A_019136-019303 yeah and i
sw04590-A_019303-020204 [silence]
sw04590-A_020204-020339 right
sw04590-A_020339-021220 [silence]
sw04590-A_021220-021822 well you know i think counseling is kind of like dieting until you decide you really want it to work you [laughter-know]
sw04590-A_021822-022632 it it's not gonna work anyway you have to cooperate with that kind of stuff i- i it's a real scary problem i don't know what the answers are
sw04590-A_022632-022866 [silence]
sw04590-A_022866-023110 [laughter]
sw04590-A_023110-023648 [noise] you know and then they bring up the thing about um whether we should have death penalties
sw04590-A_023648-024743 uh i guess you know th[e]- the top of the the bad guy ladder maybe you know some of those people would be affected but there's lots of crime going on besides murder where
sw04590-A_024743-024986 you know it's still out of hand
sw04590-A_024986-026033 [silence]
sw04590-A_026033-026179 [laughter]
sw04590-A_026179-027992 [silence]
sw04590-A_027992-029173 my husband makes a joke about well an armed society is a polite society if if good guys had guns as well as [laughter-bad] guys then you know maybe that wouldn't be but i said nah you still have survival of the fittest because
sw04590-A_029173-029674 you know then the bad guys would become better at using the [laughter-guns] [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw04590-A_029674-029818 [silence]
sw04590-B_000000-000108 [noise]
sw04590-B_000108-000445 [silence]
sw04590-B_000445-001185 no i really don't they need to do more with uh you know the police forces they need to make sure you have more people out on the street i think
sw04590-B_001185-002035 you know to try to keep track of what's going on and be harder on criminals when they go to court you know make sure they go to jail and they serve all their term [noise]
sw04590-B_002035-002304 but other than that i don't really know what about you
sw04590-B_002304-003277 [silence]
sw04590-B_003277-003419 right
sw04590-B_003419-004822 [silence]
sw04590-B_004822-004972 right
sw04590-B_004972-005098 [silence]
sw04590-B_005098-005236 right
sw04590-B_005236-005346 [silence]
sw04590-B_005346-005515 oh you do
sw04590-B_005515-007463 [silence]
sw04590-B_007463-007600 that's true
sw04590-B_007600-007914 [silence]
sw04590-B_007914-008151 um-hum oh
sw04590-B_008151-009241 i believe i believe that's true i think you have to do more the teachers as well education but before they get to the high school of course because_1 by then they're pretty much set i think
sw04590-B_009241-009514 you start way back when
sw04590-B_009514-011251 [silence]
sw04590-B_011251-011392 um-hum
sw04590-B_011392-011916 [silence]
sw04590-B_011916-012061 right
sw04590-B_012061-012486 [silence]
sw04590-B_012486-012631 right
sw04590-B_012631-013514 [silence]
sw04590-B_013514-014688 um-hum well i think that's like the problem with you know drunk drivers that people don't they're not cracking down they let them back out on the street they don't really take away their license they don't really make sure they can't drive anymore
sw04590-B_014688-015147 so people don't think it's any big deal and they just go out and do it again nothing's gonna happen to them_1
sw04590-B_015147-017732 [silence]
sw04590-B_017732-017879 um-hum
sw04590-B_017879-018634 [silence]
sw04590-B_018634-019616 right um-hum so it doesn't do any good people just do it again same thing with when you have like sexual offenders and you don't make sure they have
sw04590-B_019616-020296 adequate counseling then they just go out and do it again because you haven't really fixed their problem at all
sw04590-B_020296-021297 so and that's probably the problem too because do you bother counseling these people or you make them go to jail will it really do any good to counsel them or is it just gonna waste taxpayers' money
sw04590-B_021297-021747 [silence]
sw04590-B_021747-021954 right right
sw04590-B_021954-022189 yeah and the problem is
sw04590-B_022189-022359 yeah
sw04590-B_022359-022635 [silence]
sw04590-B_022635-023279 i guess that's why we have the problem nobody seems to [laughter-know] what to do about it but yeah that's true yeah
sw04590-B_023279-024687 [silence]
sw04590-B_024687-024864 right
sw04590-B_024864-025299 i'm just afraid that if you put back in the death penalty every place that
sw04590-B_025299-026294 people be um the juries won't want to convict a person because what happens if they are they're really innocent because_1 once and you kill them_1 they're gone you can't like fix the problem so
sw04590-B_026294-027199 there'll be that much you know there'd be really really worried about sending them to jail when they really should be in jail they'll be like well i don't know and the people who don't wanna put them_1
sw04590-B_027199-028031 you know to death who think that's wrong won't convict them either even if they really believe they're guilty because they're really just problem on their part things like that
sw04590-B_028031-029420 [silence]
sw04590-B_029420-029818 right right and if nobody had guns they would just use some other
sw04594-A_000000-000006 [noise]
sw04594-A_000006-000195 yeah go ahead
sw04594-A_000195-001386 [silence]
sw04594-A_001386-001540 [laughter]
sw04594-A_001540-003449 [silence]
sw04594-A_003449-003725 right and you make more money but it goes away anyway
sw04594-A_003725-004797 [silence]
sw04594-A_004797-005716 yeah i have three children and a house so uh it's a s[erious]- it's a serious matter but uh my wife's just starting to go back to work maybe that'll take the
sw04594-A_005716-006621 pressure off but i must [noise] i must confess the only control i have over our budget is to try and make as many things as constant as possible like
sw04594-A_006621-007635 tuition and try to make things monthly so that there are as few surprises as possible but i do[n't]- i've started keeping a budget on computer
sw04594-A_007635-008701 i guess each of the last five years and never followed through and about this time of year is when i get religion i have to do my income taxes i realize that better recording keeping would've helped and uh
sw04594-A_008701-009122 i still haven't managed to uh uh do it the way i should
sw04594-A_009122-010194 [silence]
sw04594-A_010194-010319 right
sw04594-A_010319-011025 [silence]
sw04594-A_011025-011512 right i believe if i had to that i could [noise] estimate
sw04594-A_011512-012563 all the major form all the major sources of spending uh on a monthly basis and come pretty close but i'm sure that there are a bunch of surprises in there that uh
sw04594-A_012563-013338 i would find and maybe learn how to control if i uh kept a formal budget or uh financial plan
sw04594-A_013338-013570 [noise] but
sw04594-A_013570-015012 [silence]
sw04594-A_015012-015133 yeah
sw04594-A_015133-016955 [silence]
sw04594-A_016955-018186 yeah the only problem is that if you have if you have children [noise] what you're gonna need for them a few years from now is what you need to be putting aside now and that's uh you can fool yourself if you don't set that up somehow
sw04594-A_018186-018732 [silence]
sw04594-A_018732-018856 right
sw04594-A_018856-019128 [silence]
sw04594-A_019128-019248 right
sw04594-A_019248-020212 but you'll find that the [noise] kids don't really have a very good sense of where the money is going and so they'll ask for things pretty much constantly [laughter]
sw04594-A_020212-021660 and i've i learned to say no pretty much constantly [laughter] and uh uh so i would be better if i had a budget and i had a certain amount of uh fun money that had to be spent each month or that was allowed to be spent each month i'd feel better about it [noise]
sw04594-A_021660-022220 so who knows maybe this'll get me to do it [laughter] [noise] you don't have children
sw04594-A_022220-022792 well that's a big change in life in a lot of ways but budgeting is one of them [laughter]
sw04594-A_022792-023099 [silence]
sw04594-A_023099-023235 [laughter]
sw04594-A_023235-023412 [silence]
sw04594-A_023412-023628 well that's one solution [laughter]
sw04594-A_023628-024664 [silence]
sw04594-A_024664-024865 [laughter]
sw04594-A_024865-025340 [silence]
sw04594-A_025340-026199 that's an interesting spirit but and i suppose cats are like children they don't take no for an answer [laughter] as easily [laughter] [noise]
sw04594-A_026199-026349 [silence]
sw04594-A_026349-026470 yeah
sw04594-A_026470-027265 [silence]
sw04594-A_027265-028312 yeah the hard part though is not uh it the hard part is um um setting aside for what they're gonna need in five or ten years [noise] that's uh really difficult
sw04594-A_028312-028546 yep [noise]
sw04594-A_028546-028736 right
sw04594-A_028736-029075 well i've made my confession
sw04594-A_029075-029205 [silence]
sw04594-A_029205-029320 and
sw04594-A_029320-029818 [silence]
sw04594-B_000000-000146 [noise]
sw04594-B_000146-000370 okay well um
sw04594-B_000370-001601 i've n[ever]- i've didn't really ever have to have a budget um until i quit going to Georgia Tech and um then i learned to budget really fast [laughter] um
sw04594-B_001601-002193 i had been working part-time before that and uh my parents were helping me some but um
sw04594-B_002193-002910 i got to where i mean i knew where every penny was going but then as i started making more money um
sw04594-B_002910-003540 my budget's kind of hasn't doesn't exist except for at certain times [laughter] you know
sw04594-B_003540-003693 [silence]
sw04594-B_003693-004908 right well i don't have to worry i mean i don't have to think ahead as much like you know but i haven't really saved anything i'm still trying to uh i've i have school debts i'm still paying back and stuff
sw04594-B_004908-005100 [silence]
sw04594-B_005100-005353 oh okay so you have to budget
sw04594-B_005353-006570 [silence]
sw04594-B_006570-006693 right
sw04594-B_006693-007116 [silence]
sw04594-B_007116-007251 right
sw04594-B_007251-007963 [silence]
sw04594-B_007963-008138 [laughter]
sw04594-B_008138-008647 [silence]
sw04594-B_008647-008785 um-hum
sw04594-B_008785-009120 [silence]
sw04594-B_009120-010262 yeah but even even if you do break your budget i think when you write things down or however if if you do it on the computer whatever or something where you can just constantly see exactly what where your money's going
sw04594-B_010262-011131 then you it's it's easier even if you don't stick to it i think it you know it's better to have you a little bit more conservative hm
sw04594-B_011131-013280 [silence]
sw04594-B_013280-013431 yeah
sw04594-B_013431-014650 but even i[f]- you can't i don't think have enou[gh]- a really when before when i had a strict budget it's because i had too i knew exactly [laughter-where] every penny was going before i had it but
sw04594-B_014650-015057 it's it's a little bit harder when you have a little bit more leeway
sw04594-B_015057-016147 but also it i think it's bad to have like you know say you have these debts and you you know you're paying a lot of interest on one and you wanna go ahead and get it you know paid off sometimes
sw04594-B_016147-017134 i've looked at it that way and really just you know pinched myself in other places so that i could do that you know uh pay it off and
sw04594-B_017134-017727 [silence]
sw04594-B_017727-017865 right
sw04594-B_017865-018127 [silence]
sw04594-B_018127-019014 and that's hard to see but if you if you try to be too strict on yourself then your then you just end up getting really frustrated don't ever you know just
sw04594-B_019014-019296 just blow a little bit that's you know
sw04594-B_019296-020014 [silence]
sw04594-B_020014-020432 right i remember doing that as a child [laughter]
sw04594-B_020432-020645 [noise] yeah
sw04594-B_020645-021532 [silence]
sw04594-B_021532-021668 yeah
sw04594-B_021668-022031 [silence]
sw04594-B_022031-022135 yeah
sw04594-B_022135-022331 no i sure don't
sw04594-B_022331-022687 [silence]
sw04594-B_022687-023550 oh i know i mean i've i've had i have a cat and [laughter-that's] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter] that's
sw04594-B_023550-024319 that's hard enough i mean i know but i mean you know that's a lot [laughter] some sort of you know when some there's times when i
sw04594-B_024319-024731 if i couldn't afford to buy myself groceries i would buy them_1 for her first
sw04594-B_024731-025427 you know just because you i mean you feel a lot worse because this being is completely dependent on you you know
sw04594-B_025427-025800 [silence]
sw04594-B_025800-026744 [laughter] well the[n]- [noise] uh yeah they are a lot simpler but [laughter] but i'm i'm just saying you know i
sw04594-B_026744-027362 it it would it would be hard to know that someone else's life was completely dependent on you you know [noise]
sw04594-B_027362-027998 [silence]
sw04594-B_027998-028176 right
sw04594-B_028176-028651 it's hard to see that right now even though you know you have too
sw04594-B_028651-029009 [silence]
sw04594-B_029009-029345 [laughter] yeah i'm [noise]
sw04594-B_029345-029818 i'm glad we had this conversation because_1 it makes me think i need to sit down and [laughter] maybe wri[te]-
sw04595-A_000000-000020 [noise]
sw04595-A_000020-000145 what do you think
sw04595-A_000145-001610 [silence]
sw04595-A_001610-001947 i agree i really agree with that
sw04595-A_001947-002352 [silence]
sw04595-A_002352-002487 right
sw04595-A_002487-002743 [silence]
sw04595-A_002743-002894 r[ight]- right
sw04595-A_002894-003450 [silence]
sw04595-A_003450-004596 right right yes i do i i have been thinking about this you're about the tenth person they tried to [laughter-call] for this [laughter] so i've had lots of time to think but yes i do because um
sw04595-A_004596-004988 otherwise why have a jury that's the point right ye[ah]-
sw04595-A_004988-006112 [silence]
sw04595-A_006112-007490 right right i think that you get a much fairer deal with a jury than you do with a judge and that's that's been [laughter-my] [laughter-experience] and and i really think that i think that judges are very prejudice
sw04595-A_007490-007934 to just their own idea and they wanna get it over with
sw04595-A_007934-008150 uh-huh
sw04595-A_008150-008598 [silence]
sw04595-A_008598-008753 right
sw04595-A_008753-009251 [silence]
sw04595-A_009251-009674 yeah i would feel much more confident if that were me so
sw04595-A_009674-009902 [silence]
sw04595-A_009902-010742 well it does but i think it's because people are trying to be conscientious where a judge it's their job and
sw04595-A_010742-011540 y[ou]- they just wanna speed it along and get it done and i don't think they stop and think about that individual as much as a group of people would
sw04595-A_011540-011692 yeah
sw04595-A_011692-011870 [silence]
sw04595-A_011870-012129 [laughter-yes] yes
sw04595-A_012129-012434 [silence]
sw04595-A_012434-012563 yes
sw04595-A_012563-012678 [silence]
sw04595-A_012678-012881 yes yes
sw04595-A_012881-012986 [silence]
sw04595-A_012986-013380 i think that we're having a lot of problems um
sw04595-A_013380-014698 with just everything and the whole the whole system is bugging me it really is our jails are over crowded with people like Leona Helmsley who's seventy two years old and with a blank check in front of her
sw04595-A_014698-015824 i don't think should go to jail i think the punishment should fit the crime i think that the jail should be filled with real criminals that are dangerous and i don't think they should get out on parole in three years
sw04595-A_015824-016177 i think they should [laughter-stay] there they did it they stay
sw04595-A_016177-016738 and people with traffic tickets and that there's another way to handle that i think
sw04595-A_016738-016865 so
sw04595-A_016865-018323 [silence]
sw04595-A_018323-019222 well yes but if you look at it in relation to the amount i mean it's one million dollars which to you and i sound exorbitant
sw04595-A_019222-020077 but compared to the six hundred million that they paid in five years that's like one dollar when we owe six hundred
sw04595-A_020077-020226 so
sw04595-A_020226-020388 [silence]
sw04595-A_020388-020945 they paid tax[es]- six hundred million in taxes over that five year period
sw04595-A_020945-021597 yeah so if you look at it they don't say that [noise] very much in the newspaper
sw04595-A_021597-022114 [silence]
sw04595-A_022114-022647 well possibly you know i don't know but if they're willing to correct it
sw04595-A_022647-024087 i- i don't i don't see that she belongs in jail the same as somebody who goes out and kills and walks away i mean i there are worse things that people are getting off with you know that kind of thing
sw04595-A_024087-024258 yeah
sw04595-A_024258-025598 [silence]
sw04595-A_025598-025762 well
sw04595-A_025762-026090 [silence]
sw04595-A_026090-026229 yeah
sw04595-A_026229-026479 [silence]
sw04595-A_026479-026703 get them out of society
sw04595-A_026703-026837 yeah
sw04595-A_026837-027066 [silence]
sw04595-A_027066-027454 i know i agree with you agree and
sw04595-A_027454-028384 [silence]
sw04595-A_028384-028556 i do too
sw04595-A_028556-028850 [silence]
sw04595-A_028850-029010 yeah
sw04595-A_029010-029302 it has to be a consistent thing
sw04595-A_029302-029444 yeah
sw04595-A_029444-029612 um-hum
sw04595-A_029612-029891 [silence]
sw04595-B_000000-000022 [noise]
sw04595-B_000022-000125 [silence]
sw04595-B_000125-001370 um i don't know uh regarding um should the judge [noise] do the sentencing or not i think the judge should have some i[n]- influence but i don't think the judge sh[ould]- i think that's too much
sw04595-B_001370-001697 power in the control of one person
sw04595-B_001697-003013 it uh it just doesn't seem to make sense that if the trial is by a jury of your peers that the sentencing should be somewhat along that i you know i guess the judge should give the parameters
sw04595-B_003013-003628 and then the jury should work kind of within there and if they feel exceptional one way or the other do you know what i mean
sw04595-B_003628-004011 [silence]
sw04595-B_004011-004245 [vocalized-noise] oh is that right
sw04595-B_004245-004763 [silence]
sw04595-B_004763-004887 right
sw04595-B_004887-006318 it seems to granted you're found guilty or innocent by a a group of p[eers]- of your peers but then the punishment you know can be very very severe depending on the the judge's personal uh predilection to that
sw04595-B_006318-006647 [silence]
sw04595-B_006647-006812 right
sw04595-B_006812-007006 yeah
sw04595-B_007006-007242 i i w[ould]- i
sw04595-B_007242-007810 [silence]
sw04595-B_007810-008668 right i mean they're human they're gonna have their their pet peeves and they're gonna have the things that they really care about or don't care about
sw04595-B_008668-009347 um so let a group of people ha[ve]- you know try to try to m[ake]- m[ake]- you know use that uh make that decision
sw04595-B_009347-009615 [silence]
sw04595-B_009615-010095 unfortunately though it does string out the uh process but you know
sw04595-B_010095-010908 [silence]
sw04595-B_010908-011062 yeah
sw04595-B_011062-011426 [silence]
sw04595-B_011426-012474 right see i i also think there's a problem with the plea bargaining system in our in our country in that you can uh plead to even though you're guilty as sin
sw04595-B_012474-012751 excuse me you plead to a lesser crime
sw04595-B_012751-013084 i think that that in of itself is a sin
sw04595-B_013084-013773 [silence]
sw04595-B_013773-013914 yeah
sw04595-B_013914-014175 [silence]
sw04595-B_014175-014340 yeah
sw04595-B_014340-015745 [silence]
sw04595-B_015745-015903 right
sw04595-B_015903-016129 [silence]
sw04595-B_016129-016350 yeah i well i
sw04595-B_016350-016471 [silence]
sw04595-B_016471-016599 [noise]
sw04595-B_016599-016716 yeah
sw04595-B_016716-018129 um although i'll tell you th[e]- there is something about that woman uh her crime was is what they quote call a white collar crime as opposed to a blue collar crime such as cr[ime]- stealing
sw04595-B_018129-018373 uh well [vocalized-noise] but she stole
sw04595-B_018373-019161 [silence]
sw04595-B_019161-019374 it's a lot of money
sw04595-B_019374-020000 [silence]
sw04595-B_020000-020476 that they the si[x]- the six hundred million that they what now
sw04595-B_020476-020838 [silence]
sw04595-B_020838-021050 oh i see what you're saying
sw04595-B_021050-021201 yeah
sw04595-B_021201-021446 [silence]
sw04595-B_021446-022238 w[ell]- no but they also diverted uh millions uh to their own personal assets that were hotel monies
sw04595-B_022238-023714 [silence]
sw04595-B_023714-023863 oh
sw04595-B_023863-025275 see y[eah]- yeah i have to i agree with that there are worse things that people have been getting off with but i don't think that that we then should have Leona get off i think that they should be hit even harder see i'm an advocate of the death penalty myself
sw04595-B_025275-026167 now i don't know of a lot of people that are well there are and there aren't and i just happen to feel that if somebody does the crime
sw04595-B_026167-026615 i mean if they murder somebody they take someone's life
sw04595-B_026615-027589 i just don't feel like i have to pay my tax dollars to have them in jail i- y[eah]- i just it's a tough line
sw04595-B_027589-028486 but i don't think the way we're executing the the capital punishment is is a deterrent although i think capital punishment is a deterrent
sw04595-B_028486-029196 if it's done right and that means that this is the way it is no ifs no ands no buts a certain
sw04595-B_029196-029891 right a certain number of appeals and then that's it don't stretch it out for years get it over with and get it done
